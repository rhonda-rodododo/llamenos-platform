/**
 * Deployment readiness — the checks an operator runs against a freshly
 * deployed server, before anyone is asked to use it.
 *
 * This suite is the only one that runs against a real deployment, and until
 * now it only covered telephony. Everything here is about the OTHER half: that
 * the server is shaped like a deployment rather than like a development box,
 * and that the roles it shipped with can actually do the job they name.
 *
 * Two properties every test here holds to:
 *
 *  1. **Real routes only.** `devGuard` (apps/worker/app.ts) answers 404 for
 *     every `/api/test-*` outside a development server, so a readiness suite
 *     that leans on one can only ever pass against the thing it is supposed to
 *     be distinguishing itself from (#1423).
 *  2. **Non-destructive.** This is safe to run against a live hotline: it
 *     reads, and never writes. A readiness check that seeds or resets data is
 *     one an operator cannot run on the box they actually care about.
 *
 * Run: `bun run test:live -- deployment-readiness`
 *   LIVE_BASE_URL     the deployment to check (default in playwright.live.config.ts)
 *   STAGING_ADMIN_SEED  enables the authenticated half; without it those skip
