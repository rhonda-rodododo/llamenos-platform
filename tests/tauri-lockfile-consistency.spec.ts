/**
 * `apps/desktop/Cargo.lock` <-> `apps/desktop/Cargo.toml` consistency.
 *
 * PR #895 (pinning `tauri`/`@tauri-apps/api` to matching exact versions —
 * see `tauri-version-alignment.spec.ts`) was flagged in review because its
 * `Cargo.lock` diff dropped the openmls/hpke-rs/libcrux dependency closure
 * (648 deleted lines) while `packages/crypto/Cargo.toml` still declares
 * `openmls = "0.9"`. That looked like an unreproducible, out-of-scope
 * lockfile rewrite.
 *
 * It wasn't. `mls` is an explicitly default-off feature on `llamenos-core`
 * (`packages/crypto/Cargo.toml`, decision recorded in #708): the
 * openmls -> hpke-rs -> libcrux chain carries aarch64 constant-time-timing
 * RUSTSEC advisories, so it is gated out of every shipped binary — mobile,
 * server, and desktop alike — unless a consumer opts in with
 * `--features mls`. `apps/desktop/Cargo.toml`'s `llamenos-core = { path =
 * "../../packages/crypto" }` dependency requests no features, so it never
 * activates `mls`, and the closure was never reachable from
 * `apps/desktop/Cargo.lock`'s resolved graph in the first place.
 *
 * Verified empirically while fixing the review's follow-up: restoring
 * `apps/desktop/Cargo.lock` to its pre-PR content and re-running EITHER
 * `cargo generate-lockfile` (full regen) OR the minimal
 * `cargo update -p tauri --precise 2.11.1` (scoped, PR-appropriate update)
 * both reproduce the PR's committed lockfile byte-for-byte — the openmls
 * entries that main's stale lockfile carried were themselves inconsistent
 * with the manifest (locked at openmls 0.8.1 / openmls_rust_crypto 0.5.1,
 * which does not satisfy the "0.9"/"0.6" requirement `packages/crypto`
 * actually declares) and get pruned by any cargo operation that touches the
 * file, full regen or scoped update alike. So the PR's lockfile was already
 * the unique, reproducible, `--locked`-satisfying result — and it is also
 * the *secure* one, matching the mls exclusion `packages/crypto/CLAUDE.md`
 * documents.
 *
 * This is the rail that keeps it that way: `cargo metadata --locked` is
 * cargo's own consistency check, run without a full compile. It fails
 * loudly the moment `Cargo.lock` stops satisfying `Cargo.toml` for any
 * reason (a real dependency bump forgotten from the lockfile, not just this
 * specific incident) — the exact class of drift `cargo build --locked`
 * would also catch, at a fraction of the cost.
 *
 * Mutation check performed while authoring this test: temporarily bumping
 * `apps/desktop/Cargo.toml`'s `tauri` requirement to a version the
 * committed lockfile can't satisfy (`=2.99.0`, which doesn't exist) made
 * `cargo metadata --locked` fail with cargo's own
 * `failed to select a version for the requirement` error (exit 101);
 * restoring the real pin made it pass again (see PR body for output).
 *
 * Follow-up incident: this same rail then failed on #927 — a PR whose
 * lockfile was verifiably correct (`cargo metadata --locked` passed in <1s
 * on the operator's machine) — reporting "Cargo.lock no longer satisfies
 * Cargo.toml". The CI stderr it captured showed cargo mid-resolve
 * (downloading hundreds of crates, cloning the `hpke-rs` git patch
 * dependency), not failing: on a cold runner that legitimately exceeds the
 * old 60s `execFileSync` timeout, which kills the process and lands in the
 * same `catch` block as a genuine `--locked` violation. The message never
 * distinguished "cargo concluded the lockfile is wrong" from "we killed
 * cargo before it could conclude anything." Rewritten below to classify the
 * failure into `timeout` / `environment` / `drift` before deciding what to
 * say, using cargo's own distinctive `--locked`-violation wording
 * (`needs to be updated but --locked was passed`,
 * `failed to select a version for the requirement`) as the only signal for
 * `drift`, and `ETIMEDOUT`/no-exit-status as the signal for `timeout`.
 *
 * Both new branches were verified with the same inject-the-defect method as
 * the original mutation check above (see PR body for full output):
 *   - Reverting this rewrite (collapsing all three outcomes back into one
 *     `failure: string | null`) while re-running the `tauri = "=2.11.6"`
 *     mutation still fails the test — real drift is never swallowed.
 *   - Lowering `CARGO_METADATA_TIMEOUT_MS` to a value shorter than a cold
 *     resolve reproduces the original incident's shape but now fails with
 *     the `timeout` branch's message, not the lockfile-drift message.
 *
 * A second, independent bug surfaced while verifying the above: this
 * manifest's `cargo metadata --format-version 1` output is ~3.4MB of JSON on
 * stdout, but `execFileSync` defaults `maxBuffer` to 1MB. That overflow kills
 * the process with `ENOBUFS`/SIGTERM — the exact same shape (`err.signal` set,
 * `err.status: null`) as a real timeout, and it reproduces on EVERY run
 * regardless of cache state or network speed, since it depends only on output
 * size. Verified: the unmodified original code (and a naive `timeout`-only
 * fix that doesn't also raise `maxBuffer`) fails on this repo's manifest even
 * with a fully warm cache and a sub-second cargo run, misreporting a buffer
 * overflow as either lockfile drift (original code) or a timeout (if only the
 * timeout value were fixed). Fixed by setting `maxBuffer` generously and by
 * keying the `timeout` branch strictly on `err.code === 'ETIMEDOUT'` — the one
 * code Node/Bun's `child_process` uses for its own timeout kill — so a future
 * ENOBUFS-shaped failure still lands in `environment`, not `timeout`.
