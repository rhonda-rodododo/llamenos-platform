// Rail for the class of bug fixed alongside this test: a root `overrides` entry
// that disagrees with a same-named direct `dependencies`/`devDependencies` entry.
//
// bun accepts that mismatch silently — every bun-based CI job (typecheck, unit,
// integration, BDD, `bun install --frozen-lockfile`) stays green. The mismatch only
// surfaces when something shells out to real npm, which is exactly what the release
// job's SBOM step does (`npx --yes @cyclonedx/cdxgen`). npm calls it `EOVERRIDE` and
// hard-fails:
//
//   npm error code EOVERRIDE
//   npm error Override for hono@^4.13.8 conflicts with direct dependency
//
// This happened for real: #922 bumped `dependencies.hono` to `^4.13.8` to land the
// GHSA-88fw-hqm2-52qc fix, and added `overrides.hono = ">=4.12.25"` to dedupe a
// transitive copy. bun was fine with the pair; npm was not, and the release pipeline's
// "Generate CycloneDX SBOM" step failed even though every bun-based check on the same
// commit was green. This test runs under `bun test`, i.e. in ordinary CI, so that class
// of drift is caught long before a release run reaches the npm-only step.
//
// Verified empirically against real npm (see PR description): when a package name
// appears in BOTH `overrides` and a direct dependency map at the top level, npm
// requires the two version specifiers to be byte-identical strings — not merely
// semver-compatible or one a subset of the other. A narrower, still-compatible range
// (e.g. direct `^4.13.8` vs override `^4.13.9`) still trips EOVERRIDE. So the rail
// below checks for exact string equality, matching npm's actual behavior rather than
// a looser semver-overlap approximation that would pass cases npm still rejects.
