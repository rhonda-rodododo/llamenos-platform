/**
 * Proves the Playwright session-reuse pattern actually works, end to end.
 *
 * See tests/fixtures/auth.ts and tests/bootstrap.spec.ts for the mechanics.
 * This file exists because the reuse infrastructure (per-role storageState
 * fixtures) previously existed but was never consumed anywhere — nothing
 * imported `../fixtures/auth`, so it silently bit-rotted (dead code) while
 * every real caller re-implemented a parallel, ad-hoc version in
 * tests/helpers.ts's `loginAsAdmin`. Fixed here; this spec is the load-bearing
 * proof that the fixture works, not just documentation of intent.
