 * #812: `fleet/review` retired `opencode`/Kimi as the reviewer engine
 * entirely and moved to a `claude` SESSION running on a dedicated
 * self-hosted runner (`llamenos-review-box`), on the operator's own Max
 * subscription rather than a metered, weekly-quota'd key. Most of the old
 * engine's failures were infrastructure (turn-budget exhaustion, quota,
 * UNREADABLE verdicts from a 2-3-turn cap opencode's own CLI couldn't even
 * enforce) rather than genuine misses — a session with real tools reviews
 * better than a thin per-call API hit.
 *
 * Reconciling this with #891 (2026-09-19, "fail loud on unconfigured
 * fleet/review engine, never a dead default"): that fix was about
 * `vars.FLEET_REVIEW_PROVIDER` — a SWAPPABLE provider id that had already
 * gone stale twice, silently, with a `|| 'kimi-for-coding'` literal masking
 * the day it was retired. `#812`'s redesign removes the entire class of bug
 * #891 fixed rather than re-solving it: there is no provider variable left
 * to go stale, because `claude` is the only reviewer engine
 * (`reviewerBinaryFor` hard-fails for anything else — see its doc comment in
 * review.ts). `FLEET_REVIEW_MODEL` keeps a literal default (`'sonnet'`), but
 * that is not the same failure shape: `'sonnet'` is a live, always-valid
 * model tier that a claude session can actually run, not a retired id
 * silently substituted for one that used to work. A bad value in
 * `FLEET_REVIEW_MODEL` (typo'd, or a leftover opencode-shaped id like
 * `kimi-code-plan-global/k3-256k` from before this PR) is still caught
 * LOUD, before the real review ever runs: `claude` itself refuses an
 * unrecognized `--model`, and the smoke step's `classify()` (backed by
 * `classifyEngineFailure` in review.ts) names that failure
 * `engine-misconfigured`, never a silent pass. See
 * fleet-review-smoke-step.test.ts for the behavioural rail on that
 * classification.
 *
 * This rail asserts what survived the switch and what changed on purpose:
 *   - the model is STILL a repo variable, never a hardcoded literal — the
 *     same "a provider/model change is an operator action, not a code
 *     change" property #812's own predecessor rail asserted, just for
 *     `FLEET_REVIEW_MODEL` alone now (`FLEET_REVIEW_PROVIDER` is gone: there
 *     is exactly one provider, an already-authenticated `claude` CLI, not a
 *     key-holding `auth.json` keyed by provider name);
 *   - the job runs on `[self-hosted, fleet-review]`, never a GitHub-hosted
 *     runner — that label is what actually reaches `llamenos-review-box`;
 *   - a self-hosted runner processing a PR event is dangerous enough that a
 *     fork guard is MANDATORY and must be the job's literal first step —
 *     never installed as an afterthought after a checkout has already run;
 *   - the smoke step still classifies its own failure as engine-quota /
 *     engine-auth / engine-unavailable, and the "Install"/"Authenticate"
 *     steps that used to fetch and configure the opencode binary are GONE
 *     (claude is pre-installed and pre-authenticated on the runner itself);
 *   - `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is never passed to the reviewer.
 *
 * A grep over the workflow YAML's raw text, deliberately — like the
 * `--admin`/`--force` rail above, there is no runtime behaviour to invoke
 * here (this is CI-only shell, never imported by orchestrator code), so the
 * argv/config text IS the thing to assert.

/**
 * `fleet/review` moved off `pull_request` and onto `merge_group` (#812): the
 * old trigger re-ran a non-author MODEL call — against a paid, weekly-quota'd
 * provider — on every push and every `gh pr update-branch`, and that call
 * volume is what exhausted the quota and made the repo unmergeable. That fix
 * had its own bug, found and fixed at #844: the job stayed in `ci.yml`,
 * gated by a job-level `if:` — but `ci.yml` ALSO triggers on `pull_request`,
 * so on every ordinary PR the job was still INSTANTIATED and merely skipped
 * by that `if:`, and GitHub treats a *skipped* required check as satisfying
 * it, exactly like a green one. #844 itself merged this way, with
 * `fleet/review` reporting "skipping" and no model review ever run. The real
 * fix was not a smarter `if:` — GitHub does not distinguish "correctly
 * skipped" from "should have blocked" once a job exists on the trigger at
 * all — so `fleet/review` moved into its OWN workflow file
 * (`fleet-review.yml`) at #848, on `workflow_dispatch` + `merge_group` only.
 *
 * #848's own trigger had a DIFFERENT bug, found on #848 itself:
 * `workflow_dispatch` is a repository-level event with no PR of its own, so
 * a dispatched run's check result — even a correct, passing one, verified
 * against #848's real run — never counts toward a PR's required contexts at
 * all. `gh pr view 848 --json statusCheckRollup` never listed it, and
 * `gh pr merge` refused with "the base branch policy prohibits the merge".
 * The fix here: trigger from the PR's OWN check suite — `pull_request`,
 * scoped to `types: [review_requested]` so it fires on exactly one signal
 * (#1158: a review being requested or re-requested from `llamenos-auto`, or
 * from `rhonda-rodododo` on the release PR), never on an ordinary push. The
 * `labeled` trigger this replaced could not reach a release PR at all, which
 * is #1114. A `pull_request`-triggered
 * run's check result attaches to the PR head SHA automatically, which is
 * what actually satisfies a required context — the same mechanism
 * `fleet/verify` already relies on. `merge_group` is dropped as a trigger
 * (see the "reports on merge_group" rail below for why that is safe today).
 *
 * Text assertions over the workflow files are the right instrument here, the
 * same reasoning `guards.test.ts` already applies to `orchestrator/src` argv
 * rails above: there is no runtime behaviour of a YAML trigger condition to
 * exercise, only the literal condition itself, and a regex over the source is
 * what a mutation to it actually breaks.
 *
 * `fleet/verify` moved out of `ci.yml` into its own `fleet-verify.yml` in
 * round 3 of #844 (CodeQL cache-poisoning — see the rail below this one for
 * why). `fleet/review` made the same move at #848 and changed its own
 * trigger again here, so this block now reads three files.

 * type its author never pictured a release commit arriving as.
 *
 * The fix pins the scope explicitly instead of relying on the coercion:
 * `github.event_name != 'push' || !startsWith(...)`. On `push`, behavior is
 * unchanged (the original, since-#812 intent — see commit 60b1e6c69,
 * `fix(security): audit R6 medium`, which introduced this exact guard on
 * the (now-removed) `audit` job to skip its own then-adjacent `version` job
 * on the automated release commit — knope's PR-based release flow, and
 * therefore any `pull_request` shape for a release commit, did not exist
 * yet). On every other event, the first clause short-circuits the guard to

 * reading its `dist/setup/index.js` and `dist/cache-save/index.js`), but
 * CodeQL's model never inspects that input at all — the flagged "poisonable
 * steps" are the `bun` commands themselves. The fix that actually cleared
 * the alerts (verified via the `code-scanning/alerts` API against the exact
 * commit) is what this rail asserts: `fleet-verify` moved into its OWN
 * workflow file (`fleet-verify.yml`) whose `on:` block is `pull_request` +
 * `merge_group` only — neither has default-branch cache-write access, so
 * `hasDefaultBranchCacheWriteAccess` is false for every event this job can
 * be triggered by, full stop. `no-cache: true` is kept as defense in depth
 * (asserted below) but is not what CodeQL is actually satisfied by.
 *
 * `fleet/review` is deliberately NOT covered here: it never executes HEAD
 * code, only reads it as data for the review model (the "Export the PR head
 * as data" step strips and never runs it), and its explicit
 * `secrets.FLEET_REVIEW_API_KEY` access makes CodeQL's `isPrivileged()` true
 * for that job — which this specific query excludes on purpose (a privileged
 * job reachable by an externally-triggerable event is the subject of a
 * different, more severe query instead). CodeQL agrees either way: 0 alerts
 * on `fleet/review`. If a future job gains both a head-code-execution step
 * and reachability from a workflow with `push`/`workflow_dispatch`, it needs
 * the same file-isolation treatment, not a per-step cache tweak.

/**
 * Ruleset 15885614 (the merge queue's branch protection ruleset) requires
 * exactly these four status contexts before a PR can merge: `ci-status`,
 * `gitleaks`, `fleet/verify`, `fleet/review`. A required context that never
 * reports on the queue's own `merge_group` ref blocks the merge queue
 * forever — GitHub waits indefinitely for a check that will never appear,
 * rather than failing loudly. `CodeQL` is the fifth required context but is
 * GitHub default-setup, not a workflow file in this repo, so it is
 * deliberately excluded from this table (see the operator step in the PR
 * body for verifying it separately once the queue is live).
 *
 * The mapping below is hardcoded rather than derived, on purpose: this rail
 * exists to catch a workflow file quietly losing its `merge_group` trigger
 * (as `secret-scan.yml` had, until #844), and a derived lookup would only
 * ever tell you the code agrees with itself.
 *
 * `fleet/verify` moved from `ci.yml` to its own `fleet-verify.yml` in round 3
 * of #844 (CodeQL cache-poisoning isolation — see the rail above), updated
 * here to match, or this rail would itself start failing vacuously against a
 * job that no longer exists in `ci.yml`.
 *
 * `fleet/review` IS in this table as of #1187. It used to be the documented
 * exception: `merge_group` was excluded as a trigger on the reasoning that a
 * trigger with no matching arm inside the job would recreate the fail-open
 * bug, and that the exclusion was safe while this repo's merge queue was
 * unavailable. The queue was then enabled — and #1185 sat at `position 1,
 * AWAITING_CHECKS` indefinitely with every other required context green,
 * because a required context that structurally cannot report on the queue
 * ref does not fail the entry, it stalls it forever. The queue had to be
 * turned off again.
 *
 * The fix was the arm that earlier note said the migration would need, in
 * the only form invariant 1 allows: not a job-level `if:` (a skipped
 * required check satisfies branch protection exactly like a green one) but a
 * STEP that always runs on the queue ref and always publishes a real
 * verdict, derived from the constituent PR's own existing `fleet/review`
 * rather than from a second model call. See fleet-review-merge-group.test.ts
 * for the rails on that arm.

/**
 * #664: "a PR's changes should shape which checks matter." Before this fix,
 * every heavy ci.yml job (ios-build-test, crypto-tests, e2e, backend-bdd,
 * backend-unit, desktop-unit, android-build-test, migration-drift) ran on
 * every non-docs PR regardless of what it touched — an orchestrator-only or
 * Helm-only change spent a macOS runner on an iOS build (see the "Problem"
 * section of #664 for the real dependabot/#848/#851/#855/#857 incidents this
 * caused). The fix: one classification script
 * (.github/scripts/detect-changed-platforms.sh) computes per-platform flags
 * from the changed-file list, ci.yml's `changes` job feeds it the correct
 * diff range, and every heavy job gates on the platform(s) it actually needs.
 *
 * This rail has three parts:
 *  1. Run the classification script itself against the three scenarios the
 *     #664 PR body documents (a workflows-only change, an apps/ios/-only
 *     change, a packages/protocol/-only change) and, through it, assert
 *     which ci.yml jobs actually run vs. skip for each — the property the
 *     issue is about, not just "the script returns some string".
 *  2. Pin every gated job's job-level `if:` to its exact expected text —
 *     the mutation this exists to catch is deleting the `if:` entirely
 *     (making the job unconditional again), which part 1 alone would NOT
 *     catch for jobs whose flag happens to be true in every scenario tested.
 *  3. Confirm the `changes` job diffs against the real PR/merge-group base
 *     rather than `HEAD^`, and that all three workflows that need the path
 *     map call the same script rather than re-deriving their own copy.
 *
 * `ci-status` itself already has its own rail above (every required job
 * must report on merge_group) — that rail is about REPORTING, and is
 * satisfied equally by a job that runs and a job that is cleanly skipped.
 * This rail is about the separate property that #664 is actually for:
 * which of those two things happens for a given change.
