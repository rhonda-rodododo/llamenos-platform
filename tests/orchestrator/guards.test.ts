 * #812: `fleet/review` retired `opencode`/Kimi as the reviewer engine
 * entirely and moved to a `claude` SESSION running on a dedicated
 * self-hosted runner (`llamenos-review-box`), on the operator's own Max
 * subscription rather than a metered, weekly-quota'd key. Most of the old
 * engine's failures were infrastructure (turn-budget exhaustion, quota,
 * UNREADABLE verdicts from a 2-3-turn cap opencode's own CLI couldn't even
 * enforce) rather than genuine misses — a session with real tools reviews
 * better than a thin per-call API hit.
 *
 * Reconciling this with #891 (2026-09-19, "fail loud on unconfigured
 * fleet/review engine, never a dead default"): that fix was about
 * `vars.FLEET_REVIEW_PROVIDER` — a SWAPPABLE provider id that had already
 * gone stale twice, silently, with a `|| 'kimi-for-coding'` literal masking
 * the day it was retired. `#812`'s redesign removes the entire class of bug
 * #891 fixed rather than re-solving it: there is no provider variable left
 * to go stale, because `claude` is the only reviewer engine
 * (`reviewerBinaryFor` hard-fails for anything else — see its doc comment in
 * review.ts). `FLEET_REVIEW_MODEL` keeps a literal default (`'sonnet'`), but
 * that is not the same failure shape: `'sonnet'` is a live, always-valid
 * model tier that a claude session can actually run, not a retired id
 * silently substituted for one that used to work. A bad value in
 * `FLEET_REVIEW_MODEL` (typo'd, or a leftover opencode-shaped id like
 * `kimi-code-plan-global/k3-256k` from before this PR) is still caught
 * LOUD, before the real review ever runs: `claude` itself refuses an
 * unrecognized `--model`, and the smoke step's `classify()` (backed by
 * `classifyEngineFailure` in review.ts) names that failure
 * `engine-misconfigured`, never a silent pass. See
 * fleet-review-smoke-step.test.ts for the behavioural rail on that
 * classification.
 *
 * This rail asserts what survived the switch and what changed on purpose:
 *   - the model is STILL a repo variable, never a hardcoded literal — the
 *     same "a provider/model change is an operator action, not a code
 *     change" property #812's own predecessor rail asserted, just for
 *     `FLEET_REVIEW_MODEL` alone now (`FLEET_REVIEW_PROVIDER` is gone: there
 *     is exactly one provider, an already-authenticated `claude` CLI, not a
 *     key-holding `auth.json` keyed by provider name);
 *   - the job runs on `[self-hosted, fleet-review]`, never a GitHub-hosted
 *     runner — that label is what actually reaches `llamenos-review-box`;
 *   - a self-hosted runner processing a PR event is dangerous enough that a
 *     fork guard is MANDATORY and must be the job's literal first step —
 *     never installed as an afterthought after a checkout has already run;
 *   - the smoke step still classifies its own failure as engine-quota /
 *     engine-auth / engine-unavailable, and the "Install"/"Authenticate"
 *     steps that used to fetch and configure the opencode binary are GONE
 *     (claude is pre-installed and pre-authenticated on the runner itself);
 *   - `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is never passed to the reviewer.
 *
 * A grep over the workflow YAML's raw text, deliberately — like the
 * `--admin`/`--force` rail above, there is no runtime behaviour to invoke
 * here (this is CI-only shell, never imported by orchestrator code), so the
 * argv/config text IS the thing to assert.

/**
 * `fleet/review` moved off `pull_request` and onto `merge_group` (#812): the
 * old trigger re-ran a non-author MODEL call — against a paid, weekly-quota'd
 * provider — on every push and every `gh pr update-branch`, and that call
 * volume is what exhausted the quota and made the repo unmergeable. That fix
 * had its own bug, found and fixed at #844: the job stayed in `ci.yml`,
 * gated by a job-level `if:` — but `ci.yml` ALSO triggers on `pull_request`,
 * so on every ordinary PR the job was still INSTANTIATED and merely skipped
 * by that `if:`, and GitHub treats a *skipped* required check as satisfying
 * it, exactly like a green one. #844 itself merged this way, with
 * `fleet/review` reporting "skipping" and no model review ever run. The real
 * fix was not a smarter `if:` — GitHub does not distinguish "correctly
 * skipped" from "should have blocked" once a job exists on the trigger at
 * all — so `fleet/review` moved into its OWN workflow file
 * (`fleet-review.yml`) at #848, on `workflow_dispatch` + `merge_group` only.
 *
 * #848's own trigger had a DIFFERENT bug, found on #848 itself:
 * `workflow_dispatch` is a repository-level event with no PR of its own, so
 * a dispatched run's check result — even a correct, passing one, verified
 * against #848's real run — never counts toward a PR's required contexts at
 * all. `gh pr view 848 --json statusCheckRollup` never listed it, and
 * `gh pr merge` refused with "the base branch policy prohibits the merge".
 * The fix here: trigger from the PR's OWN check suite — `pull_request`,
 * scoped to `types: [labeled]` so it fires on exactly one signal (the
 * `review` label), never on an ordinary push. A `pull_request`-triggered
 * run's check result attaches to the PR head SHA automatically, which is
 * what actually satisfies a required context — the same mechanism
 * `fleet/verify` already relies on. `merge_group` is dropped as a trigger
 * (see the "reports on merge_group" rail below for why that is safe today).
 *
 * Text assertions over the workflow files are the right instrument here, the
 * same reasoning `guards.test.ts` already applies to `orchestrator/src` argv
 * rails above: there is no runtime behaviour of a YAML trigger condition to
 * exercise, only the literal condition itself, and a regex over the source is
 * what a mutation to it actually breaks.
 *
 * `fleet/verify` moved out of `ci.yml` into its own `fleet-verify.yml` in
 * round 3 of #844 (CodeQL cache-poisoning — see the rail below this one for
 * why). `fleet/review` made the same move at #848 and changed its own
 * trigger again here, so this block now reads three files.

 * `if: "!startsWith(github.event.head_commit.message, 'chore(release):')"`,
 * unconditionally, on a workflow that ALSO triggers on `pull_request` and
 * `merge_group`. `github.event.head_commit` only exists on a `push`
 * payload — on every other event it is `null`, and `startsWith(null, ...)`
 * coerces to `startsWith('', ...)`, which is `false`, so the negated guard
 * happened to evaluate to "run" there. That is an accident of null
 * coercion, not a scoped condition: the day this job (or one shaped like
 * it) gains any OTHER push-shaped trigger, or GitHub's null-coercion
 * behavior for a removed context field ever changes, the same starvation
 * reappears from a different angle. `ci-status`, `gitleaks`, `fleet/verify`
 * and `fleet/review` are all REQUIRED contexts (ruleset 15885614); a
 * required context that never reports blocks a merge exactly like a red
 * one, and unlike a plain bug this one is invisible in a diff review — the
 * guard reads correct in isolation, it only starves on the specific event
 * type its author never pictured a release commit arriving as.
 *
 * The fix pins the scope explicitly instead of relying on the coercion:
 * `github.event_name != 'push' || !startsWith(...)`. On `push`, behavior is
 * unchanged (the original, since-#812 intent — see commit 60b1e6c69,
 * `fix(security): audit R6 medium`, which introduced this exact guard on
 * the (now-removed) `audit` job to skip its own then-adjacent `version` job
 * on the automated release commit — knope's PR-based release flow, and
 * therefore any `pull_request` shape for a release commit, did not exist
 * yet). On every other event, the first clause short-circuits the guard to
 * always-run, by construction rather than by what a missing field happens

 * in `ci.yml`). The mechanism, read from CodeQL's own `actions` query pack
 * (`codeql/actions-all`, `CachePoisoningQuery.qll` + `PoisonableSteps.qll` +
 * `ext/config/poisonable_steps.yml`), is NOT about any specific
 * cache-writing action:
 *
 * - `poisonableCommandsDataModel` lists bare command names whose lifecycle
 *   scripts/plugins could act on the job's ambient `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN`
 *   (which grants cache read/write independent of any `actions/cache` step
 *   being present at all) — `bun` is literally on that list, alongside
 *   `npm`/`cargo`/`pip install -r`/etc. Every `run: bun ...` step in the job
 *   is a "poisonable step" by definition, regardless of caching config.
 * - `hasDefaultBranchCacheWriteAccess(job, event)` is true when the job's
 *   EVENT has default-branch cache-write scope — `push`, `workflow_dispatch`,
 *   `repository_dispatch`, `delete`, `registry_package`, `page_build`, or
 *   `schedule` (NOT `pull_request`, NOT `merge_group` — neither appears in
 *   that list). Critically, `JobImpl.getATriggerEvent()` returns every event
 *   the ENCLOSING WORKFLOW responds to, not filtered by the job's own `if:`.
 *   `fleet-verify` sat in `ci.yml`, which also triggers on `push` and
 *   `workflow_dispatch` for its other jobs, so CodeQL treated `fleet-verify`
 *   as reachable from both — regardless of its `if:` excluding them.
 *
 * Tried first and confirmed NOT sufficient: `no-cache: true` on the "Setup
 * Bun" step. It genuinely disables `setup-bun`'s own cache-save (verified by
 * reading its `dist/setup/index.js` and `dist/cache-save/index.js`), but
 * CodeQL's model never inspects that input at all — the flagged "poisonable
 * steps" are the `bun` commands themselves. The fix that actually cleared
 * the alerts (verified via the `code-scanning/alerts` API against the exact
 * commit) is what this rail asserts: `fleet-verify` moved into its OWN
 * workflow file (`fleet-verify.yml`) whose `on:` block is `pull_request` +
 * `merge_group` only — neither has default-branch cache-write access, so
 * `hasDefaultBranchCacheWriteAccess` is false for every event this job can
 * be triggered by, full stop. `no-cache: true` is kept as defense in depth
 * (asserted below) but is not what CodeQL is actually satisfied by.
 *
 * `fleet/review` is deliberately NOT covered here: it never executes HEAD
 * code, only reads it as data for the review model (the "Export the PR head
 * as data" step strips and never runs it), and its explicit
 * `secrets.FLEET_REVIEW_API_KEY` access makes CodeQL's `isPrivileged()` true
 * for that job — which this specific query excludes on purpose (a privileged
 * job reachable by an externally-triggerable event is the subject of a
 * different, more severe query instead). CodeQL agrees either way: 0 alerts
 * on `fleet/review`. If a future job gains both a head-code-execution step
 * and reachability from a workflow with `push`/`workflow_dispatch`, it needs
 * the same file-isolation treatment, not a per-step cache tweak.

 * Ruleset 15885614 (the merge queue's branch protection ruleset) requires

 * reports on the queue's own `merge_group` ref blocks the merge queue
 * forever — GitHub waits indefinitely for a check that will never appear,
 * rather than failing loudly. `CodeQL` is the fifth required context but is
 * GitHub default-setup, not a workflow file in this repo, so it is
 * deliberately excluded from this table (see the operator step in the PR
 * body for verifying it separately once the queue is live).
 *
 * The mapping below is hardcoded rather than derived, on purpose: this rail
 * exists to catch a workflow file quietly losing its `merge_group` trigger
 * (as `secret-scan.yml` had, until #844), and a derived lookup would only
 * ever tell you the code agrees with itself.
 *
 * `fleet/verify` moved from `ci.yml` to its own `fleet-verify.yml` in round 3
 * of #844 (CodeQL cache-poisoning isolation — see the rail above), updated
 * here to match, or this rail would itself start failing vacuously against a
 * job that no longer exists in `ci.yml`.
 *

 * `merge_group` entirely (see the "runs once per review label" rail above):
 * a `workflow_dispatch`-only trigger could never satisfy a required PR
 * context in the first place (verified on #848), and keeping `merge_group`
 * as a trigger while excluding it from the job's `if:` would recreate the
 * exact fail-open bug this whole file of rails exists to catch. This is safe
 * TODAY because this repo's merge queue is unavailable (owner type `User` —
 * the ruleset's `merge_queue` rule is rejected outright, see
 * fleet-review.yml's own header). The day an org migration enables the
 * queue, `fleet/review` genuinely will not report on a `merge_group` ref and
 * the queue will stall on it forever — that migration must re-add a
 * `merge_group` arm to both the trigger and the job's `if:` together, not
 * silently inherit this gap. The assertion below pins that `fleet/review`

 * #630, and the same run class on #626 — was one step earlier: `bun
 * orchestrator/src/cli.ts review-gate` a few steps into `fleet-review.yml`
 * assumes the BASE checkout it runs from has both `orchestrator/src/cli.ts`
 * and a `review-gate` command registered in it. GitHub does not refresh an
 * open PR's `base.sha` on every push to the base branch — only on a
 * synchronize/update event on the PR itself — so a PR nobody has touched in
 * days (dependabot PRs routinely sit for weeks) can carry a `base.sha` from
 * well before either landed on main, with nothing on the PR side having
 * removed anything.
 *
 * #630's base predated `orchestrator/src/cli.ts` entirely → bun's own
 * uncaught `error: Module not found`, no `outcome` output, job goes red
 * with no diagnostic. #626's base had `cli.ts` but predated `review-gate`
 * being registered in `HANDLERS` → `usage: llamenos-fleet <doctor|tick|...>`
 * (no `review-gate` in the list), exit 2, same result. Because the crash
 * happens INSIDE the gate step, the existing "Check the base provides the
 * gate" step (guarding `review-ci`, further down, `if:
 * steps.gate.outputs.outcome == 'run-engine'`) can never be reached to
 * explain either case — `outcome` was never set.
 *
 * This rail pins the fix: a NEW, unconditional step — "Check the base
 * provides the review gate itself" — runs BEFORE "Decide whether to run the
 * review engine" and checks both failure shapes in bash (the only language
 * that can run before bun has even confirmed `cli.ts` exists), turning a

/**
 * #664: "a PR's changes should shape which checks matter." Before this fix,
 * every heavy ci.yml job (ios-build-test, crypto-tests, e2e, backend-bdd,
 * backend-unit, desktop-unit, android-build-test, migration-drift) ran on
 * every non-docs PR regardless of what it touched — an orchestrator-only or
 * Helm-only change spent a macOS runner on an iOS build (see the "Problem"
 * section of #664 for the real dependabot/#848/#851/#855/#857 incidents this
 * caused). The fix: one classification script
 * (.github/scripts/detect-changed-platforms.sh) computes per-platform flags
 * from the changed-file list, ci.yml's `changes` job feeds it the correct
 * diff range, and every heavy job gates on the platform(s) it actually needs.
 *
 * This rail has three parts:
 *  1. Run the classification script itself against the three scenarios the
 *     #664 PR body documents (a workflows-only change, an apps/ios/-only
 *     change, a packages/protocol/-only change) and, through it, assert
 *     which ci.yml jobs actually run vs. skip for each — the property the
 *     issue is about, not just "the script returns some string".
 *  2. Pin every gated job's job-level `if:` to its exact expected text —
 *     the mutation this exists to catch is deleting the `if:` entirely
 *     (making the job unconditional again), which part 1 alone would NOT
 *     catch for jobs whose flag happens to be true in every scenario tested.
 *  3. Confirm the `changes` job diffs against the real PR/merge-group base
 *     rather than `HEAD^`, and that all three workflows that need the path
 *     map call the same script rather than re-deriving their own copy.
 *
 * `ci-status` itself already has its own rail above (every required job
 * must report on merge_group) — that rail is about REPORTING, and is
 * satisfied equally by a job that runs and a job that is cleanly skipped.
 * This rail is about the separate property that #664 is actually for:
 * which of those two things happens for a given change.
