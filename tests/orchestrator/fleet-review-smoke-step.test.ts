/**
 * Rail for the "Smoke-test the review engine" step in fleet-review.yml
 * silently swallowing an engine failure (see the PR that added this file,
 * #872 — updated for #866, which retired `opencode` as the reviewer engine
 * entirely and rewrote this step to invoke `claude` directly instead).
 *
 * Root cause (#872, still the invariant this file guards): GitHub runs a
 * `run:` step with no `shell:` override as `bash -e {0}` — `-e` is active
 * from the moment the script starts. The step's own `set -uo pipefail` does
 * NOT clear an inherited `-e`; it only adds `-u`/`pipefail` on top. Two
 * captures in the step — `run_out="$(... claude ...)"` and
 * `verdict_out="$(... bun -e ...)"` — are UNGUARDED (no `||` after the
 * assignment), so the first one that fails is itself a failing simple
 * command under `-e`: the script would die on that line, before
 * `run_status=$?`/`verdict_status=$?` are ever read, before `classify()`
 * runs, before `fail()` ever prints anything. The fix is `set +e` right
 * after `set -uo pipefail`, clearing the inherited `-e` so both captures
 * reach their own status check and, on failure, `fail()`. #866 replaced the
 * engine underneath this step (opencode → claude) but did not change this
 * shape at all — the same two unguarded captures exist in the claude-based
 * script, so the fix (and this rail) stays required verbatim.
 *
 * This is a real functional test, not a text/regex rail over the YAML: it
 * extracts the step's ACTUAL `run:` script with a YAML parser (so it always
 * tests the literal bytes GitHub would run, and can never drift from a
 * hand-copied snippet), executes it with `bash -e <script>` — the same
 * invocation GitHub uses for an unshelled step — against a fake `claude`
 * binary on PATH, and asserts on the real stdout/stderr and exit code.
 *
 * Reproduced the underlying mechanism first, in isolation (three lines: an
 * assignment from a command that exits 1 under `set -uo pipefail` inside a
 * script invoked as `bash -e`, followed by an echo — the echo never runs).
 * See the PR body for that transcript.
 *
 * Also guards the SEPARATE #866-of-its-own-PR bug this file's tests were
 * extended for: this step used to hardcode `claude` and `$FLEET_REVIEW_MODEL`
 * directly in the workflow YAML, agreeing with the real review's own engine
 * resolution (`invokeVerifierEngine`, via `reviewerInvocationFor` in
 * review.ts) only by coincidence — a coincidence that broke the moment one
 * side changed without the other (see `reviewerInvocationFor`'s doc comment
 * for the live incident). The step now resolves its binary/model with a
 * `bun -e` import of `reviewerInvocationFor` from the SAME review.ts the
 * real review calls, so the two can no longer disagree about what "the
 * reviewer" even is. The tests below at the bottom of this file
 * (`describe('rail: smoke and review must derive from one source', ...)`)
 * prove this empirically: they resolve the engine/model independently (a
 * standalone `bun -e` call with the identical env) and assert the step's
 * own printed line matches it exactly, then mutate the step to hardcode the
 * engine/model again and prove that same equality breaks.
