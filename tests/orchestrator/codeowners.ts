/**
 * CODEOWNERS stopped being documentation with this change: it IS the fleet's
 * "this needs a human" gate now, enforced by GitHub's "require review from
 * Code Owners" rule rather than by a function in this repo that only this
 * repo obeyed. So the tests that used to assert `mayAutoMerge` refused a
 * sensitive diff assert coverage of this file instead — against the real
 * file and the real tracked tree, never a fixture, because a fixture would
 * keep passing while the shipped one lost an entry.
 *
 * Matched with the `ignore` package, which implements gitignore semantics —
 * the SAME syntax GitHub parses CODEOWNERS with. This is the whole point of
 * the round that introduced it: the previous check compared pattern strings
 * with `startsWith`, so `apps/worker/lib/auth` "covered"
 * `apps/worker/lib/auth.ts` as far as the test was concerned, while GitHub
 * read it as a file literally named `auth` and matched nothing at all. A
 * string comparison can only ever check that two lists agree with each other;
 * it cannot check that either one means anything. Do not replace this with a
 * bespoke glob — the value here is using the same semantics as the consumer.

 *
 * Two environments, one answer. On a checkout, `git ls-files` is exact. Under
 * `fleet/verify` the suite runs inside a `git archive` EXPORT of the commit
 * under judgement — deliberately no `.git`, so no git command can run there —
 * and a walk of that directory is if anything MORE exact, because an archive
 * contains precisely the tracked files at that commit and nothing else. The
 * only thing to exclude is `node_modules`, which the workflow symlinks in
 * from the trusted base install and which git never tracked.
 *
 * The result is asserted non-trivial before it is returned: a walk that
 * silently found nothing would turn every coverage assertion below into a
 * vacuous pass, which is the precise failure mode these tests exist to
 * prevent.
