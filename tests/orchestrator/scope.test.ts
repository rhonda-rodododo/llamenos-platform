  // The fragment used to say backend owns the whole tests/steps/ tree ("Step

  // That was wrong at the file-content level: of the 144 *.ts files under
  // tests/steps/, 139 import `@playwright/test` and drive a real browser
  // `page` fixture — Playwright is desktop-only tooling (CLAUDE.md: "E2E via
  // Playwright (desktop)"), and the two files under tests/steps/ that don't
  // import it but still live outside tests/steps/backend/ (common/before-hooks.ts,
  // config/test-backend-server.ts) turn out to be desktop-only too on inspection
  // (page.addInitScript / a harness proving desktop's net_fetch origin
  // handling). The only genuinely API-only, browser-free step code lives
  // under tests/steps/backend/ — and playwright.config.ts's own `backend-bdd`
  // project definition says so directly: `steps: "tests/steps/backend/**/*.ts"`,
  // while its `bdd` (desktop) project loads every other tests/steps/<dir>
  // via `desktopStepDirs`. Five separate PRs in the 2026-09-22 fleet/verify
  // triage (#853, #854, #897, #916, #917) were desktop E2E flake fixes
  // (isVisible()/.first() probe sweeps — a defect that can only exist in
  // browser-driving code) rejected as "outside lane desktop's scope" for
  // touching tests/steps/<domain>/*.ts files that are desktop's in every
  // way except this one stale ownership line.
  //
  // The fix narrows backend's grant from all of tests/steps/ down to
  // tests/steps/backend/ (mirroring desktop's existing notOwned carve-out,
  // now equally narrowed) — not a blanket grant of tests/steps/ to desktop;

  // --- Lane boundary fix, 2026-09-22: four PRs blocked on the same

  // (root.package.json's `lint` script, each PR's actual diff, CLAUDE.md's
  // "129 .feature files tagged @backend/@desktop/@ios/@android"), not
  // invented — mirrors #938 (packages/i18n/locales/) and #943
  // (tests/steps/backend/) in shape: narrow, evidence-led grants, never a
  // blanket "everyone owns everything" widening.
  //
  // Four distinct fixes, each independently evidenced:
  //
  // 1. eslint.config.js / lefthook.yml — root tooling config, structurally a
  //    flat array of independent, path-scoped rule blocks (confirmed by
  //    reading #890's actual diff: its new block is `files: ['src/client/**/
  //    ...', 'tests/**/*.ts'], ignores: ['tests/steps/**/*.ts']` — scoped to
  //    exactly desktop's own trees). package.json's root `lint` script is
  //    `eslint src/ apps/worker/ orchestrator/ tests/orchestrator/` — of the
  //    four platform lanes, only desktop (src/, tests/) and backend
  //    (apps/worker/) are covered by it; android and iOS have no ESLint-
  //    relevant owned paths at all (Kotlin/Swift), and shared's #836 (the
  //    "shared third" of the same #647 split) landed clean without touching
  //    either file, confirming shared does not need this grant. Backend's own
  //    tracking issue #702 explicitly lists "apps/worker, sip-bridge,
  //    signal-notifier and tests/steps are added to the lefthook pre-commit
  //    ESLint glob" as an acceptance criterion — backend WILL need this grant
  //    even though #887/#847/#908 (the backend PRs on hand) happen not to
  //    exercise it yet.
  //
  // 2. src/server/ — NOT desktop's. It is the Bun server bootstrap that
  //    imports directly from apps/worker/{db,services,lib} and wires up the
  //    Hono app onto Bun's native HTTP — backend's domain by every import in
  //    the file. #890 touched it only incidentally (a mechanical lint fix,
  //    3 lines) while it was nobody's declared path at all. Moved to
  //    backend's owned list; deliberately NOT added to desktop's — #890
  //    keeps exactly one file strayed, and that is the correct outcome (see
  //    the PR-by-PR table in this fix's PR body).
  //
  // 3. tests/steps/fixtures.ts — genuinely shared: every directory under
  //    tests/steps/ imports it (grep confirms all 19, both backend's
  //    tests/steps/backend/ and every desktop-owned domain directory).
  //    #887's diff narrows RolesWorld.cachedRoles from `Array<Record<string,
  //    unknown>>` to a real `RoleDefinition[]` — a type backend needed
  //    tightened, that both lanes' consumers must then satisfy. Desktop
  //    already owns this file via its blanket `tests/` grant; only backend
  //    needed the explicit narrow add.
  //
  // 4. packages/test-specs/features/ — CLAUDE.md already states test-specs
  //    is "129 .feature files tagged @backend/@desktop/@ios/@android"; grep
  //    confirms real tag counts across all four (90/50/32/31 files
  //    respectively). #847 and #908 both add clean, single-tag `@backend`
  //    scenarios to files that already exist under packages/test-specs/
  //    features/security/ — no cross-tag edits, no touch to
  //    packages/test-specs/tools/ (the coverage checker, #836 confirms that
  //    stays shared-exclusive). Narrow carve-out granted to all four platform
  //    lanes, mirroring packages/i18n/locales/ exactly; packages/test-specs/
  //    tools/ and the repo docs at its root (README.md, STEP_VOCABULARY.md,
  //    package.json) stay shared-supervisor-exclusive.
  //
  // 5. playwright.config.ts — desktop already owns the whole file. #908 adds
  //    a `backend-bdd-global-setting` Playwright project object (additive,
  //    scoped to `steps: "tests/steps/backend/**/*.ts"`) alongside the
  //    existing `backend-bdd` project — both are backend's own test-project
  //    definitions inside a file desktop otherwise owns, the same shape
  //    #943 already established for this exact file. Narrow shared-write
  //    added for backend.
  //
  // 6. scripts/test-backend-bdd.sh — package.json's `test:backend:bdd` script
  //    target, already named as backend's own quality gate in this fragment's
  //    "Quality Gates" section before this fix. `scripts/` as a whole is a
  //    mixed bag (android-parallel-e2e.sh, ios-build.sh, release/, etc.) with
  //    no single owner and is NOT granted wholesale here — only the one file
  //    #908 actually touches.
  //
  // What was deliberately NOT done: tests/steps/admin/, tests/steps/auth/,
  // and tests/steps/cases/ (also touched by #887) are NOT granted to backend.
  // Those edits are genuine, unaccommodated strays — see this fix's PR body
  // for the verdict on #887 and #890.
