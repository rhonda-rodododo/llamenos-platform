/**
 * Rail for #1230: every `fleet/review` outcome gets its OWN name, on the
 * check, where people read it.
 *
 * `fleet/review` has well over a dozen outcomes and used to render every red
 * one identically. Six consecutive reds were escalated as a dead review
 * engine (five were Dependabot PRs correctly refused as `not-requested`); a
 * helper refused a legitimate retry on #1263 because an unparseable verdict
 * looked exactly like a rejection; and the "Assert this run reached a real
 * verdict" step reported every REAL rejection as `review-did-not-run`.
 *
 * Every test here runs the REAL thing — the workflow steps' own `run:`
 * scripts, parsed out of fleet-review.yml with a YAML parser and executed
 * with `bash -e` exactly as GitHub runs an unshelled step, and the real
 * `runReviewCi` — never a hand-copied snippet that could drift from what
 * ships. The "the rail can fail" block proves the assertions discriminate:
 * a title regressing to null, or to the wrong string, is caught.
