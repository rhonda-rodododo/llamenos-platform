 * Enter a PIN into the PinInput component.

 *
 * Uses clear + type() instead of fill() to ensure React processes each keystroke
 * and updates component state before we press Enter. With fill(), React may not
 * have committed the state update by the time Enter fires, causing the
 * handleKeyDown closure to see the old (empty) value and skip onComplete.
 *
 * After typing, we verify the input value matches expectations before pressing
 * Enter to trigger onComplete.
 *
 * Failure reporting: this is the single most common login-adjacent flake in the
 * suite (30+ call sites, each an independent chance for a CI-load timing race to
 * fire). A raw Playwright timeout here surfaces as a generic locator error
 * attributed to whatever *feature* spec happened to call this first — the true
 * fault (login) gets misdiagnosed as a regression in the feature under test. Each
 * step below is wrapped so the thrown error names the login step that failed,
 * not just "timeout", matching the pattern already used by #872/#929.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT assert what happens after Enter (navigation, error
 * message, dialog close, etc.) — callers intentionally submit wrong PINs
 * expecting to stay in place (see pin-challenge-steps.ts, pin-lockout-steps.ts),
 * so "no navigation" is not a universal failure signal here. Callers own that
 * postcondition with their own, correctly-scoped assertion.

 * containers make PBKDF2 significantly slower — see Timeouts.AUTH above).

 * from ADMIN_SEED via a second, slower reload+enterPin path whenever the cache
 * looked stale. That fallback never actually fires: `/api/test-reset` (the only
 * reset endpoint called anywhere between bootstrap and a loginAsAdmin() call — see
 * tests/screenshots.spec.ts) re-seeds the SAME admin identity by the SAME fixed
 * ADMIN_PUBKEY (apps/worker/routes/dev.ts `ensureInit`), so the cached key stays
 * valid. Keeping a silent, untested fallback path was itself a flake risk — a
 * second, divergent code path through enterPin() that only real breakage would
 * ever exercise, at exactly the worst time to discover it doesn't work. If the
