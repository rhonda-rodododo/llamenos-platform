# EP02: Device & Identity Management

**Date:** 2026-05-12
**Status:** Specced
**Depends on:** EP01 (Permission System & Role Management — provides admin shell, nav infrastructure, role definitions)

## Summary

This epic ports v1's device and identity management features to v2 and extends them with v2's per-device Ed25519/X25519 crypto architecture:

1. Adding a dedicated `/security/*` route tree with tabbed navigation for user device, session, passkey, and security history management
2. Implementing device list, device revocation (with sigchain + PUK + hub key rotation), and device rename across all platforms
3. Building active session management (view, terminate, sign-out-everywhere, emergency lockdown)
4. Enhancing WebAuthn passkey management with rename, transport badges, and backup status
5. Creating a security event timeline with append-only `security_events` table
6. Adding admin device oversight section in the admin shell (hub-scoped device inventory, SAS emoji verification)
7. Building the user-role assignment UI (multi-select picker) that EP01 deferred
8. Delivering device list, session management, and security events on iOS and Android

This covers Tier 1 of the device observability spec (`2026-05-03-device-observability-ux.md`) except T1.5 alert delivery (security event table is built but push/Signal notification wiring is deferred), plus admin device oversight from Tier 2. Anomaly detection, push delivery tracking, sigchain visualization, health dashboards, and lost device wizards are out of scope.

## Design Decisions

### D1: Dedicated `/security` route tree

Device, session, and security management gets its own tabbed route layout at `/security/*`, separate from `/settings`. This matches v1's architecture and prevents the settings page from becoming a monolith.

| Route | Tab label | Content |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `/security/devices` | Devices | Device list, rename, revoke, fingerprint display |
| `/security/sessions` | Sessions | Active session list, terminate, sign-out-everywhere, emergency lockdown |
| `/security/passkeys` | Passkeys | Enhanced WebAuthn credential management |
| `/security/history` | History | Security event timeline, report suspicious, JSON export |

The `/security` layout component renders a tab bar and `<Outlet />`. TanStack Router file-based routing: `src/client/routes/security.tsx` (layout) + `src/client/routes/security/devices.tsx`, etc. Navigation entry point: sidebar icon or settings link — not embedded in admin shell (this is user-facing, not admin-facing).

### D2: Per-user (global) device verification

SAS emoji verification confirms a device's Ed25519 pubkey, which is bound to the user's sigchain — a per-user, not per-hub, structure. Verification status is therefore global.

| Aspect | v1 (per-hub) | v2 (per-user) |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Scope | Hub-scoped verification | Global verification |
| Storage | Hub device table | `device_verifications` table keyed by `(verifierPubkey, deviceId)` |
| Visibility | Admin sees per-hub | Admin sees global status across all hubs |
| Re-verify | Per hub on join | Once per device, persists across hubs |

The `device_verifications` table stores: `id`, `verifierPubkey`, `targetDeviceId`, `targetPubkey`, `verifiedAt`, `signedAuditEntry` (the Ed25519-signed audit entry from the verifier). Admin device oversight views show a verified/unverified badge per device based on whether any admin has verified it.

### D3: Global emergency lockdown

Lockdown means "my account is compromised." There is no per-hub lockdown — compromise is account-level.

**Lockdown flow:**
1. User triggers lockdown from `/security/sessions` via `LockdownModal`
2. Requires fresh PIN unlock or WebAuthn assertion (elevated auth)
3. **Phase 1 (server):** Terminate all sessions except current, create `account_lockdown` security event
4. **Phase 2 (client-driven):** Client rotates PUK (re-seal to current device only), then iterates all user's hubs and rotates each hub key. Each hub key rotation is an individual operation — partial failure is acceptable (retried on next app launch). The server cannot generate hub keys (zero-knowledge).
5. All other devices receive 401 on next request and must re-authenticate
6. Post-lockdown: user should review device list and revoke any unknown devices

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/account/lockdown` — requires elevated auth. Server terminates sessions and returns `{ sessionsTerminated: number, hubIds: string[] }`. Client then performs PUK rotation and hub key rotations client-side, reporting completion via `POST /api/account/lockdown/complete`.

### D4: SAS emoji table from `packages/crypto`

The emoji table is a constant exported from the Rust crate, available via UniFFI (mobile), WASM (browser test), and Tauri IPC (desktop). Single source of truth — no platform-specific emoji tables.

**SAS derivation** (in Rust):
1. Input: `min(verifierEd25519Pubkey, targetEd25519Pubkey) || max(...) || sessionNonce(32 bytes)` — canonical ordering by lexicographic comparison prevents role-confusion
2. HKDF-SHA256 with domain separation label `LABEL_SAS_DERIVE`, output 42 bits (ceil(7 * 6 / 8) = 6 bytes)
3. Extract seven 6-bit values (0–63) from the HKDF output for unbiased indices into the 64-entry emoji table
4. Display: 7 emojis in a row, verifier and target compare visually

**Nonce transport:** The session nonce is generated by the verifier (admin) and communicated to the target device owner **out-of-band** — either verbally in person, via a separate secure channel, or displayed as a QR code that the target device scans. The nonce is not transmitted via any API relay to prevent server manipulation.

**New domain separation label:** `LABEL_SAS_DERIVE` added to `packages/protocol/crypto-labels.json`.

The SAS derivation function signature (Rust): `fn derive_sas(pubkey_a: &[u8; 32], pubkey_b: &[u8; 32], nonce: &[u8; 32]) -> [u8; 7]` — internally canonicalizes pubkey order. Exposed via `platform.ts` IPC command `derive_sas` on desktop, UniFFI `CryptoService.deriveSas()` on mobile.

### D5: Auto-detect all device metadata

All device metadata is auto-detected. Only `deviceName` is user-editable (defaults to auto-detected value).

| Field | Desktop (Tauri) | iOS | Android | Editable |
|-------|-----------------|-----|---------|----------|
| `deviceName` | `os.hostname()` | `UIDevice.current.name` | `Build.MODEL` | Yes |
| `deviceModel` | `os.arch() + platform` | `utsname.machine` mapped | `Build.MODEL` | No |
| `osVersion` | `os.release()` | `UIDevice.current.systemVersion` | `Build.VERSION.RELEASE` | No |
| `appVersion` | `Cargo.toml` version via Tauri | `Bundle.main.infoDictionary` | `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME` | No |

Metadata is sent on `POST /api/devices/register` and refreshed on each session creation. No manual entry forms.

```

### Data flow (device revocation)

```
1. User taps "Remove" on DeviceCard
2. Confirmation dialog: "Remove [name]? It will lose access to all encrypted content."
3. On confirm (requires fresh PIN/WebAuthn):
   a. POST /api/devices/:id/revoke { confirm: true }
   b. Server (atomic transaction):
      - Append device_remove sigchain link (signed by requesting device)
      - Delete device record
      - Rotate PUK (exclude removed device from re-sealing)
      - Rotate hub keys for all user's hubs
      - Create security_event { type: 'device_remove', deviceId }
      - Push notification to remaining devices
   c. Client invalidates device list + session queries
4. Revoked device: next API call → 401, next key unlock → sigchain check → "Device removed" screen
```

### Data flow (SAS verification — admin)

```
1. Admin opens DevicesSection, clicks "Verify" on unverified device
2. VerifyFingerprintModal opens
3. Client generates 32-byte session nonce
4. Client calls platform.deriveSas(adminPubkey, targetPubkey, nonce) → 7 emoji indices
5. Admin reads emojis aloud (or compares in person) with device owner
6. Device owner calls platform.deriveSas(adminPubkey, targetPubkey, nonce) → same 7 emojis
7. Both confirm match
8. Admin's client calls platform.signAuditEntry({ type: 'device_fingerprint_verified', targetDeviceId, targetPubkey, nonce })
9. POST /api/devices/:id/verify { signedAuditEntry }
10. Server stores verification in device_verifications table
```

### User-role assignment UI

EP01 established the role definitions, permission engine, and backend support for multi-role assignment (role ID arrays). EP02 adds the UI.

**Component:** `UserRoleAssignment` — a multi-select picker showing available roles with descriptions. Used in:
- Admin user profile/detail view (admin assigns roles to users)
- Invite code creation (pre-assign roles to invitees)

**Behavior:** Checkboxes per role, grouped by scope (hub roles vs platform roles). Shows permission count per role. Submits as an array of role IDs via `PATCH /api/users/:pubkey` (existing endpoint, already accepts `roles` array).

## Security Considerations

- **Device private keys never in JS**: All SAS derivation, signing, and key operations route through `packages/crypto` via Tauri IPC (desktop), UniFFI (iOS), JNI (Android). The webview/JS layer only sees pubkeys and derived SAS indices.
- **SAS binds to fresh nonce**: Each verification session generates a 32-byte random nonce. The SAS is derived from `verifierPubkey || targetPubkey || nonce` via HKDF with domain separation. Pre-computation attacks are prevented by the nonce.
- **Elevated auth for destructive ops**: Device revocation, sign-out-everywhere, emergency lockdown, and security preference changes require a fresh PIN unlock or WebAuthn assertion — not just a valid session token.
- **IP handling**: Raw IPs are never stored. `lastIpHash = HMAC-SHA256(IP, SERVER_HMAC_SECRET)` for anomaly grouping. Coarse geo resolved on-the-fly for display, never persisted.
- **Zero-knowledge admin boundary**: Admins see hub-scoped device lists with verification status and aggregate stats. Admins cannot view user sessions, session tokens, or session activity — that would violate the zero-knowledge principle.
- **Security events are append-only**: The `security_events` table has no UPDATE or DELETE operations. For GDPR erasure, `userPubkey` is set to `'deleted'` — events are anonymized, not removed, preserving audit integrity.
- **Device metadata is self-reported**: `deviceModel`, `osVersion`, `appVersion` come from the client. Never trusted for security decisions — used only for display and observability.
- **Revocation cascades**: Device revocation atomically creates a `device_remove` sigchain link, rotates PUK (excluding revoked device), and rotates hub keys for all hubs. Forward secrecy is maintained — the revoked device cannot decrypt any content encrypted after revocation.
- **Rate limiting**: Device revocation (3/hour), session termination (10/hour), device registration (5/hour per user), WebAuthn registration (3/hour), security event queries (30/minute), admin overview (10/minute).

## Open Questions (Resolved)

1. **Migrate v1 security routes or integrate into settings?** → D1: Dedicated `/security/*` route tree with tabbed navigation. Device/session/security management is complex enough to warrant its own route layout.

2. **Admin device verification scope — per-hub or per-user?** → D2: Per-user (global). SAS verification confirms the device's Ed25519 pubkey which is bound to the user's sigchain, not to any hub.

3. **Emergency lockdown scope — per-hub or global?** → D3: Global. Lockdown means "account is compromised" and terminates all sessions, rotates PUK, rotates all hub keys.

4. **SAS emoji table — custom table or from packages/crypto?** → D4: From `packages/crypto`. The emoji table is a constant in the Rust crate, available on all platforms via UniFFI/WASM/IPC.

5. **Device metadata — auto-detect or manual entry?** → D5: Auto-detect everything. Only `deviceName` is user-editable (defaults to auto-detected hostname/model).
