## Security Architecture Summary

### Cryptographic Foundation

All cryptographic operations are implemented once in `packages/crypto/` (Rust), compiled to native (Tauri desktop), WASM (browser testing), and UniFFI (iOS/Android). There is no separate JS crypto implementation for production use.

| Primitive | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| HPKE (RFC 9180, X25519-HKDF-SHA256-AES256-GCM) | All key wrapping (notes, messages, files, hub key, PUK) |
| Ed25519 | Device signing keys, auth tokens, sigchain entries |
| X25519 | Device encryption keys, HPKE decapsulation |
| AES-256-GCM | Symmetric encryption (notes, messages, HPKE AEAD) |
| XChaCha20-Poly1305 | Hub event encryption (WebSocket events) |
| Argon2id (64MB, 3 iterations, 4 parallelism) | PIN/passphrase-to-KEK derivation for device key storage |
| HMAC-SHA256 | Phone/IP hashing, blind index generation |
| **Shamir GF(2^8)** | Recovery group key escrow (K-of-N threshold, information-theoretic security) |
| **Domain separation labels** (see `crypto-labels.json`) | Albrecht defense — label enforced at decrypt |

> All labels are defined in `packages/protocol/crypto-labels.json` (source of truth) and registered in the Rust `LABEL_REGISTRY` with stable indices. See the JSON file for the current count.

### End-to-End Encrypted (Zero-Knowledge for Content)

The server **cannot read** these, even under legal compulsion:

| Data | Encryption | Forward Secrecy |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Call notes (text + custom fields) | AES-256-GCM + HPKE wrapping | Yes (per-note random key) |
| Call transcriptions | AES-256-GCM + HPKE wrapping | Yes (per-transcription key) |
| Encrypted reports | AES-256-GCM + HPKE wrapping | Yes (per-report key) |
| File attachments | AES-256-GCM + HPKE wrapping | Yes (per-file key) |
| Messages (SMS/WhatsApp/Signal) | AES-256-GCM + HPKE wrapping | Yes (per-message key) |
| CMS contacts/cases | AES-256-GCM + HPKE wrapping | Yes |
| Draft notes | AES-256-GCM (HKDF-derived key) | No (deterministic key, local-only) |
| Device private keys | Argon2id + AES-256-GCM | N/A (platform secure storage) |
| Role names/descriptions | AES-256-GCM + HPKE wrapping | Yes (per-admin for platform; hub-key for hub) |
| Team names/descriptions | AES-256-GCM + hub-key encryption | N/A (hub-key symmetric) |
| Tag labels/categories | AES-256-GCM + hub-key encryption | N/A (hub-key symmetric) |
| Blast message content | AES-256-GCM + HPKE wrapping | Yes (per-blast key) |
| Entity type definitions | AES-256-GCM + hub-key encryption | N/A (hub-key symmetric) |
| Entity field values (3-tier) | AES-256-GCM + HPKE wrapping | Yes (per-entity key) |
| Evidence chain metadata | AES-256-GCM + HPKE wrapping | Yes (per-evidence key) |
| Shift/ring group names | AES-256-GCM + hub-key encryption | N/A (hub-key symmetric) |
| Recovery group shares | AES-256-GCM + HPKE wrapping | Yes (per-share holder) |
| PUK seed (recovery escrow) | AES-256-GCM + HPKE wrapping | Yes (under recovery group pubkey) |

> **Note:** The server is zero-knowledge for note/message/file **content**. The server DOES see metadata (timestamps, routing, call durations) and processes plaintext momentarily during SMS/WhatsApp outbound sends. See [What We Do NOT Claim](#what-we-do-not-claim).

### Identity Model

- **Per-device Ed25519/X25519 keys** — not a single "nsec" per user
- **Sigchain** — append-only, hash-chained, Ed25519-signed device authorization log
- **PUK (Per-User Key)** — user-level key hierarchy with Cascading Lazy Key Rotation (CLKR)
- **Hub key** — random 32 bytes, HPKE-wrapped per member, rotated on departure
- **MLS** (RFC 9420) — group state management (always compiled; no feature flag)
- **Hub event epoch rotation** — server event key rotates every 24 hours for forward secrecy
- **SFrame** — voice E2EE key derivation (media frame encryption planned — see [Security Gaps](SECURITY_GAPS_AND_ROADMAP.md#13-sframe-voice-e2ee-low))
- **SAS emoji verification** (EP02) — out-of-band device identity confirmation (HKDF-derived 7-emoji sequence)
- **Recovery groups** (EP09) — Shamir K-of-N key escrow with sigchain-anchored pubkey transparency
- **Account erasure cascade** (EP08) — 4-phase cryptographic erasure with active re-encryption
- **PBAC permission system** (EP01) — granular permission catalog with multi-role union model

### Server-Accessible Under Subpoena

| Data | Storage | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Call metadata | Plaintext | Timestamps, durations, which user answered |
| Caller phone hashes | HMAC-SHA256 | Irreversible without HMAC secret |
| User public keys | Plaintext | Ed25519 signing + X25519 encryption pubkeys |
| Sigchain entries | Plaintext | Device authorization log (pubkeys, not private keys) |
| Shift schedules (timing) | Plaintext | Start/end times needed for routing |
| Audit logs | Plaintext | IP hashes (truncated), timestamps, actions |
| Encrypted blobs | Ciphertext | Notes, messages, files — encrypted but present |

## What We Do NOT Claim

- **Traffic analysis resistance (full)**: Hub events are padded to power-of-2 buckets (min 512B), but no dummy traffic or cover traffic — patterns from connection timing remain visible
- **Metadata confidentiality**: Server needs timestamps, routing data, and event counts; caller numbers are HMAC-hashed and User-Agent SHA-256 hashed, country is not stored — but connection metadata remains
- **SMS/WhatsApp transport E2EE**: Provider sees plaintext during transit; Signal-first routing (when the recipient has Signal) avoids this, and SMS notification-only mode omits message content from SMS bodies — but provider-visible delivery still occurs
- **WebSocket metadata privacy**: The server handles all event distribution; authenticated connections only; content is per-hub encrypted with epoch-rotating keys — server cannot fake events but can observe connection metadata
- **PIN brute-force resistance (offline) — now significantly improved**: Minimum 8 digits or alphanumeric passphrase (8+ chars); Argon2id (64MB, 3 iterations, 4 parallelism) replaces PBKDF2 for strong GPU/ASIC resistance. Seizure of encrypted blob requires defeating Argon2id in addition to guessing credential.
- **Deletion verification**: Cannot cryptographically prove hosting provider deleted data
- **SFrame voice media encryption**: Key derivation is implemented; per-frame AES-128-CTR + HMAC encryption is planned but not yet complete
- **Blast message transport E2EE**: Bulk messages sent via SMS/WhatsApp/Telegram/RCS are visible to providers in transit; Signal-routed blasts are E2EE; content is E2EE at rest in the database
- **Recovery share holder coercion resistance**: K-of-N Shamir prevents any single share holder from recovering data, but coordinated coercion of K holders can reconstruct the recovery key; mitigated by configurable delay and duress detection

## Known Security Gaps

For a complete inventory of known gaps, incomplete implementations, and planned improvements, see [Security Gaps and Roadmap](SECURITY_GAPS_AND_ROADMAP.md).

Highlights (9 open gaps remain, 5 resolved in PR #288):
- ~~Domain separation label registry drift~~ — RESOLVED: all labels now in Rust registry (87 total after EP01-EP09)
- ~~WebAuthn enforcement~~ — RESOLVED: server-side enforcement added
- ~~Sigchain server-side signature validation~~ — RESOLVED: Ed25519 verification added
- ~~Audit log chain verification~~ — RESOLVED: `GET /api/audit/verify` endpoint added
- ~~Signal notification ECIES wiring~~ — RESOLVED: replaced with HPKE via platform.ts
- **Tauri Stronghold** is initialized but device keys are stored via `tauri-plugin-store`
- **SFrame** has key derivation but no media frame encryption
- **Certificate pinning** is scaffolding only (placeholder pins)
- **iOS DEBUG blocks** in security-critical paths need production build verification

### New Attack Surfaces (EP01-EP09)

The threat model has been updated with attack surfaces from 9 major epics. Key areas requiring auditor attention:

- **Blast/broadcast** (EP05): Bulk message delivery amplifies SMS/WhatsApp provider exposure; per-channel rate limiting is the primary control
- **Recovery groups** (EP09): Shamir secret sharing introduces a new key escrow path; sigchain-anchored pubkey transparency prevents server substitution
- **Account erasure** (EP08): 4-phase cryptographic cascade with active re-encryption; co-approver mechanism for emergency overrides
- **Entity system** (EP06): 3-tier envelope model for granular decryption access; evidence custody chains with hash linking
- **Permission system** (EP01): Role metadata encryption (platform roles: per-admin HPKE; hub roles: hub-key) protects organizational structure
- **SAS verification** (EP02): Out-of-band emoji verification with HKDF derivation; nonce never relayed via server
