# Incident Response Runbook

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-05-02

Procedures for responding to security incidents affecting a Llamenos deployment. For key-specific procedures (admin key compromise, device seizure, hub key rotation), see [Key Revocation Runbook](KEY_REVOCATION_RUNBOOK.md).

**Audience**: Administrators and operators responsible for a Llamenos instance.

## Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Response Time | Examples |
|-------|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Critical** | Active compromise with data exfiltration risk | Immediate (< 1 hour) | Admin key compromise, server breach with running exploit |
| **High** | Confirmed compromise, no active exfiltration detected | < 4 hours | Device seizure, hostile user departure, CI/CD compromise |
| **Medium** | Suspected compromise or vulnerability discovered | < 24 hours | Unusual audit log patterns, dependency vulnerability |
| **Low** | Hardening gap or policy violation | < 1 week | Missing security header, expired backup rotation |

## 1. Server Compromise

### Detection Signals
- Unauthorized processes or containers running
- Unexpected configuration changes in audit log
- Anomalous outbound network connections
- Modified application binaries or container images
- Alerts from Trivy / security scanning

### Response

1. **Assess scope**: Determine if the attacker has access to the running application, database, or just the host OS.

2. **E2EE content is safe**: Even with full server access, the attacker cannot read E2EE note content, messages, or files. The server stores only ciphertext and HPKE envelopes.

3. **Rotate all server-side secrets**:
   ```bash
   # Generate new secrets
   openssl rand -hex 32  # New PG_PASSWORD
   openssl rand -hex 32  # New SERVER_NOSTR_SECRET
   openssl rand -hex 32  # New HMAC_SECRET

   # Update .env and redeploy
   docker compose down
   # Update .env with new values
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Rotate telephony credentials**: Regenerate API keys/tokens for Twilio, SignalWire, etc. in their dashboards.

5. **Review audit logs**: Check for unauthorized actions during the compromise window.

6. **Rotate hub key**: If the attacker could have captured hub key material from server memory, rotate immediately (see [Key Revocation Runbook, Section 4](KEY_REVOCATION_RUNBOOK.md#4-hub-key-rotation-ceremony)).

7. **Notify users**: Users' device keys are client-side and unaffected. They may need to re-authenticate after session invalidation.

8. **Forensics**: If the server is a VPS, request a disk image from the provider before rebuilding. Preserve logs.

9. **Rebuild**: Deploy fresh from a known-good commit. Verify with reproducible build (`scripts/verify-build.sh`).

### What the Attacker Could NOT Obtain
- Note content, message content, file content (E2EE)
- Device private keys (client-side only)
- PUK seeds (HPKE-wrapped, server has ciphertext only)

### What the Attacker COULD Obtain
- Plaintext metadata (call timestamps, durations, routing data)
- HMAC secret (can reverse phone hashes to phone numbers)
- Telephony credentials (can make API calls to telephony providers)
- Server Nostr secret (can impersonate server on relay)
- Hub key (if captured from memory — can decrypt hub events)

---

## 2. CI/CD Compromise

### Detection Signals
- Unauthorized workflow runs in GitHub Actions
- Modified workflow files or repository secrets
- Unexpected deployments or container image pushes
- Supply chain alerts (compromised GitHub Action, dependency)

### Response

1. **Revoke all GitHub repository secrets** immediately.
2. **Audit recent commits** and deployments — check for unauthorized changes.
3. **Verify all GitHub Actions are SHA-pinned** (not floating tags).
4. **Rebuild and redeploy** from a known-good commit:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --since="2 weeks ago"  # Find last known-good commit
   git checkout <known-good-sha>
   docker compose build --no-cache
   docker compose up -d
   ```
5. **Rotate server-side secrets** (attacker may have exfiltrated from CI environment).
6. **Verify reproducible build**: Run `scripts/verify-build.sh` against the redeployed version.

---

## 3. User Account Compromise

A user's device keys have been compromised (stolen credentials, phishing, malware).

### Response

1. **Deactivate the user** in admin panel (sessions auto-revoked).
2. **Deauthorize compromised device** via sigchain (`remove-device` entry).
3. **Assess exposure**:
   - The compromised user's notes are accessible to the attacker (author envelope)
   - Other users' notes are NOT accessible (per-note HPKE wrapping, different keys)
   - Hub events during the compromise window may be accessible if the user held the hub key
4. **Rotate hub key** (Section 4 of Key Revocation Runbook).
5. **Generate a new invite** for the user to re-onboard with fresh device keys.

---

## 4. Dependency Vulnerability

A critical vulnerability is discovered in a dependency (Rust crate, npm package, Docker base image).

### Response

1. **Assess impact**: Is the vulnerability exploitable in Llamenos's usage of the dependency?
2. **Patch immediately** if exploitable:
   ```bash
   # Rust dependencies
   cargo update -p <crate-name>
   cargo test --manifest-path packages/crypto/Cargo.toml --features mobile
   cargo audit

   # npm dependencies
   bun update <package-name>
   bun audit

   # Docker base images
   # Update SHA256 pins in docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile
   docker compose build --no-cache
   ```
3. **Deploy the patched version**.
4. **If the vulnerability is in crypto dependencies** (`hpke`, `ed25519-dalek`, `x25519-dalek`, `aes-gcm`): Treat as Critical severity regardless of CVSS score. These crates underpin all E2EE properties.

## 5. Data Breach Notification (GDPR)

If personal data of callers or users may have been exposed:

### Timeline
- **72 hours**: Notify supervisory authority (from time of becoming aware)
- **Without undue delay**: Notify affected data subjects (if high risk)

### Notification Content
1. Nature of the breach and compromised data types
2. Categories and approximate number of data subjects affected
3. Likely consequences
4. Measures taken (key rotation, session invalidation, patches)
5. Contact details of DPO or responsible person

### Documenting the Breach
Record in the audit log:
- Discovery timestamp
- Scope assessment
- Actions taken with timestamps
- GDPR notification status

## 6. Communication Templates

### Internal (to users)

> **Security Notice**: We detected [unauthorized access to / a vulnerability in] our infrastructure on [date]. Your encrypted notes and messages remain protected — our end-to-end encryption ensures the server cannot read your data. As a precaution, we have [rotated keys / invalidated sessions / etc.]. You may need to re-authenticate. If you notice any unusual activity, contact your administrator immediately.

### External (to supervisory authority)

> We are reporting a personal data breach pursuant to Article 33 GDPR. On [date], we became aware that [description]. The breach affects approximately [N] data subjects. Due to our end-to-end encryption architecture, [note content / messages / files] were not accessible to the attacker. The following plaintext data may have been exposed: [metadata types]. We have taken the following remediation steps: [list].

---

## Post-Incident Review

After every Critical or High severity incident:

1. **Timeline reconstruction**: Document what happened, when, and how it was detected.
2. **Root cause analysis**: Identify the underlying vulnerability or failure.
3. **Remediation verification**: Confirm all fixes are deployed and effective.
4. **Process improvements**: Update this runbook, hardening guide, or monitoring based on lessons learned.
5. **Update threat model**: If the incident revealed a new attack vector, update [THREAT_MODEL.md](THREAT_MODEL.md).
