# First deploy: fresh VPSes → running platform

The exact, ordered procedure for taking two brand-new VPSes to a running
Llámenos deployment: an **encrypted platform host** (app + API, Postgres, RustFS
object storage, Caddy TLS, desktop-updater origin, backups) and an **unencrypted
relay host** that runs only the ntfy push relay. Read
[Two hosts, two tiers](#2-two-hosts-two-tiers) first: it is the reason for the
split and the rules that keep it safe. Every command below was checked against the
files in this repository; where something could **not** be verified without a
real server it is called out under [What only a real server will prove](#what-only-a-real-server-will-prove).

## 1. Choosing a host: two hard requirements

Host selection is constrained by two properties. Both are security properties of
the deployment, not conveniences; a host that cannot meet them is not a
candidate however cheap or well-located it is.

These apply to the **platform host**, which holds every secret. The relay host
needs only (b); see [Two hosts, two tiers](#2-two-hosts-two-tiers).

**(a) Custom ISO boot and a remote console.** Full-disk encryption with remote
LUKS unlock only works if you can boot *our* installer ISO and type the LUKS
passphrase at a console. A provider that only offers its own OS images, or has
no VNC/iKVM console, cannot do this, and FDE-with-remote-unlock does not
transfer to it.

**(b) TLS terminates on your own box, with a Let's Encrypt (ISRG-chained)
certificate.** The Android client pins ISRG Root X1/X2 and **hard-fails**
(`apps/android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`, plus an
OkHttp `CertificatePinner` in `ApiService.kt`; no soft-fail, no cleartext
fallback). A CDN, reverse-proxy product, "managed TLS" or any provider feature
that terminates TLS in front of the VPS presents a different certificate chain,
and **Android will not connect at all**. Concretely: no Cloudflare proxy
("orange cloud"), no provider load balancer, no TLS-terminating DDoS shield. DNS
records for this deployment must be DNS-only.

A third, policy constraint: provider jurisdiction must pass the strict test in
[`iso-install.md` → Choosing a provider](iso-install.md#choosing-a-provider)
(zero US operations).

| Host | Custom ISO + console | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **1984 Hosting** (Iceland) | Yes — ISO attached by **support ticket** (URL + SHA-256), noVNC console. FDE install verified 2026-04-19. | **Platform host** (`llamenos-platform1`, `llamenos_disk_encrypted: true`). Also hosts authoritative DNS. |
| **FlokiNET** | **Unverified**, so treated as **no full-disk encryption**. | **Relay host** (`llamenos-relay1`, `llamenos_disk_encrypted: false`): the ntfy push relay only. Nothing that holds secrets at rest may run there, and preflight enforces it. |

The OpenTofu module `deploy/opentofu/modules/1984hosting/` is a **runbook, not
automation** (1984 has no OpenTofu provider). You do not need OpenTofu at all;
this document is the supported path.

---

## 2. Two hosts, two tiers

The deployment is split by one property, **is the disk encrypted?**, recorded per
host in the inventory as `llamenos_disk_encrypted`. It is required on every host
(preflight fails without it) and it is what the safety checks read — not the
provider name — so a self-hoster with a different provider mix gets the same
protection.

| Host | Disk | Runs | DNS names |
|---|---|---|---|
| `llamenos-platform1` (1984) | LUKS2 FDE, remote unlock | app + API, PostgreSQL, RustFS, Caddy, updater origin, backups; every secret, incl. the APNs key | `api.`, apex, `updates.`, `releases.` |
| `llamenos-relay1` (FlokiNET) | **not encrypted** | ntfy (UnifiedPush) + a Caddy that serves only its vhost | `push.` |

**Why the relay may go on an unencrypted disk.** A push relay needs reachability
and takedown resistance, not secrecy of its contents. **Its metadata is not
safe, though:** a device topic next to a timestamp records which volunteer's
device was woken and when, and a client address next to it is a volunteer's IP.
Anything that *accumulates* on an unencrypted disk is readable by whoever later
holds that disk (the provider under compulsion, a hypervisor-level adversary, a
seized or cloned image). So the relay host is a **no-secrets-at-rest tier**, and
these controls make that true rather than hoped-for:

| Control | Where | How it is checked |
|---|---|---|
| No app, database, storage, Signal, PBX or internal-TLS keys on an unencrypted host, **including via an empty inventory group** (an empty group means "every host") | `playbooks/tasks/guard-disk-tier.yml` (preflight) | Preflight refuses the deploy |
| Backups, restores, updates/rollbacks and the observability stack never run on it | `playbooks/tasks/skip-unencrypted-host.yml` | Those plays end for that host before any task |
| ntfy keeps its message cache **in memory** (no `NTFY_CACHE_FILE`), and no attachments, web-push store, log file or `server.yml` | `roles/llamenos-ntfy/tasks/guard-no-persistence.yml` | The play fails on the rendered compose body; after start, the role fails unless `/var/lib/ntfy` holds only `auth.db` |
| No access log for the push vhost; Caddy's error log drops client IP/port, `X-Forwarded-For` and the URI (= the device topic) | `roles/llamenos-caddy` (global `log` filter on unencrypted hosts) | Asserted against the config Caddy itself adapts from the deployed Caddyfile |
| Local log retention cut to one 1 MB file per container; ntfy at `warn` (at `info` it writes a per-minute activity counter) | ntfy and Caddy compose templates | Measured: at `warn`, publish/subscribe/rejected-token traffic logs nothing |

`deploy/ansible/scripts/check-disk-tier-guards.py` proves each row: it runs every
guard on the shipped two-host layout (must pass) and on the injected defect
(must fail with the guard's own message) — e.g. the relay in `llamenos_db`, an
empty `llamenos_storage`, `NTFY_CACHE_FILE` in the compose body, a `log` directive
in the push vhost.

**What is at rest on the relay host, and why each item is acceptable:**

| Item | Why it is acceptable |
|---|---|
| ntfy `auth.db`: the `llamenos-app` account, its token (with last use time/address — the platform host's), the ACL, a publish counter | The token can only **publish**, and it cannot address anyone: publishing needs a device topic, and no topic is stored. Rotatable without touching devices (`roles/llamenos-ntfy/README.md`). |
| `/opt/llamenos/services/ntfy/.publish-token` | The same credential as in `auth.db`, kept so re-runs do not mint a new one. |
| Caddy data volume: the Let's Encrypt account key and the `push.` certificate + key | Unavoidable to terminate TLS on the box (requirement (b)). A disk holder could impersonate `push.` until the certificate expires or is revoked — and would see what the relay already sees. Revoke and re-issue if the host is compromised. The ACME account email is in the Caddyfile. |
| Up to 1 MB of recent ntfy (warnings and errors) and Caddy log lines each | No client addresses or topics (see above). |
| Compose files, the Caddyfile, OS and Docker state | No secrets. |

Not on it: PostgreSQL, RustFS, backups, the APNs key, hub keys, any `.env` with
application secrets.

**In memory only (not at rest), and a caveat about "opaque payloads".** ntfy
keeps recent messages in RAM for redelivery (default 12 h). The notification
payloads are two-tier HPKE ciphertext, but the Android **incoming-call wake**
(`sendNtfyVoipPush` in `apps/worker/lib/voip-push.ts`) is currently plain JSON:
`type`, `call-id` and `hub-id`. So the relay's memory — not its disk — holds
which hub rang which device topic. Disk encryption would not protect a running
host against that anyway; encrypting that payload is an app-side follow-up.

**Not done: log shipping to Loki.** The relay's logs are *minimised at the source*
(above) rather than shipped to the platform host. Shipping needs the
observability stack, which cannot start as written (its compose files join a
`llamenos-observability` network that nothing creates; `playbooks/observability.yml`
creates `llamenos_monitoring`), and a cross-host ingest path — Loki has no
published port, auth or TLS, so the relay could reach it only through a new
authenticated public endpoint on the platform host. That is a decision for the
operator, not a side effect of this change. Until it is made, observability runs
on encrypted hosts only.

### Which push path each client uses

| Client | Transport | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| **Android** | UnifiedPush via ntfy. The backend publishes to `https://push.<domain>/<topic>` with the write-only token; the phone's **ntfy distributor app** (a separate app — see `deploy/PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS.md`) holds the subscription. The Llámenos app itself never connects to `push.` | **Relay host** |
| **iOS** | APNs with PushKit VoIP (`apps/worker/lib/voip-push.ts`). The backend opens its own TLS connection to Apple signed with the APNs `.p8` key (`APNS_KEY_P8`/`APNS_KEY_ID`/`APNS_TEAM_ID`); Apple does not allow relaying that through a third-party broker, and the key is a secret at rest | **Platform host** — cannot move to the relay |
| **Desktop** | No push service. While the app runs, it holds a WebSocket to the hub (`/ws` on `api.`; `src/client/lib/relay/`, routed through the Rust WS proxy under Tauri) and rings on the `call:ring` event (`src/client/lib/hooks.ts` → `startRinging` + a webview `Notification`). A closed desktop app is not rung | **Platform host** (the API) |

So "all push on FlokiNET" holds for Android only; iOS and desktop stay with the
backend on the encrypted host.

---

## 3. What you need before you start

**Workstation** (Linux/macOS; nothing here runs on the server until Ansible does):

```bash
# Ansible. CI validates with ansible==14.1.0 (the full package, which bundles
# community.docker, community.general and ansible.posix).
pipx install ansible          # or: pip install --user ansible
ansible --version | head -1   # ansible-core >= 2.18 (preflight checks: the roles use `meta: end_role`)

# Only needed if you installed ansible-core instead of the full package:
ansible-galaxy collection install community.docker community.general ansible.posix

docker --version              # to build the FDE ISO and the app image
bun --version                 # `bun run build:iso`, `bun run bootstrap-admin`
just --version                # optional; the justfile is a thin wrapper over ansible-playbook
age-keygen --help >/dev/null  # backup encryption key (step 4)
```

**Accounts / inputs** you must supply (nothing in this repo can guess them):

| Input | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| Domain you control (apex), authoritative DNS you can edit | `domain` in `vars-production.yml` |
| Email for Let's Encrypt notices | `acme_email` |
| Platform VPS public **IPv4**, plus netmask/CIDR and gateway (1984 needs static IP at install time), disk device (1984 KVM: `/dev/vda`) | `ansible_host` of `llamenos-platform1`; ISO build flags |
| Relay VPS public **IPv4** and a sudo-capable SSH user on its stock Debian image | `ansible_host` / `ansible_user` of `llamenos-relay1` |
| Your admin machine's public egress IP(s) | `ssh_allowed_cidrs` |
| An ed25519 SSH key pair for the `deploy` user | ISO build flag `--ssh-key`; `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` |
| A LUKS passphrase (30+ chars, in a password manager — **no recovery exists**) | typed at the console during install |
| An Ansible **vault password** | see [What the vault password is for](#what-the-vault-password-is-for) |
| A published app container image | see [Getting the app image onto the server](#getting-the-app-image-onto-the-server) |

### Resolve these blockers *before* deploy day

Found while validating this procedure without a server. They are real and each
one stops or silently degrades the deploy:

1. **The default app image does not exist.** `llamenos_app_image` defaults to
   `docker.io/llamenos/llamenos:latest`; that repository does not resolve, the
   `Docker Build` workflow has only ever run once (failed, 2026-04-29), and it
   never pushes a `latest` tag anyway. You **must** set `llamenos_app_image`
   explicitly — see [Getting the app image onto the server](#getting-the-app-image-onto-the-server).
2. **Android pins `llamenos.org` only.** `network_security_config.xml` has a
   single `<domain-config>` for `llamenos.org` (with `includeSubdomains`). If the
   production domain becomes `llamenos-hotline.org`, that file (and the
   OkHttp/URLSession defaults) must be updated in the same change that moves the
   domain — otherwise the OS-level pin-set does not apply to the new hostnames.
   The app-level `CertificatePinner` already applies the ISRG pins to whatever hub
   host the user configures. Note the `pin-set expiration="2027-01-01"`.
   `push.llamenos-hotline.org` needs **no** entry there: the Llámenos app never
   connects to it — the separate ntfy distributor app does, with its own (system
   CA) trust store.
3. **The desktop update manifest generator produces an empty manifest** for the
   real release artifacts (see [Serving desktop updates](#serving-desktop-updates-from-this-box)).
   The updater channel cannot work — on any host — until that is fixed.

## 4. The sequence

Working directory for every `ansible-playbook` command: `deploy/ansible/`.

### Step 1 — Order both VPSes and record their network parameters

**Platform (1984):** the OS you pick is wiped by the FDE install. Note the **IPv4
address, prefix length/netmask, gateway, IPv6 (if any)** and the **disk device**.
Sizing floor from `docs/runbooks/deploy-self-hosted.md`: ≥ 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM,
40 GB disk (preflight enforces ≥ 10 GiB free on `/` and ≥ 512 MiB free RAM).

**Relay (FlokiNET):** the provider's stock **Debian 12 or 13** image (no FDE — that
is the point of the tier). ntfy and Caddy are small; the same preflight floor
applies (≥ 10 GiB free on `/`, ≥ 512 MiB free RAM). Note its **IPv4**. Create a
non-root user with sudo and your ed25519 public key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
(the provider's console or first-login instructions), and confirm:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key> <relay-user>@<relay-ipv4> 'sudo -n true && echo sudo-ok'
```

### Step 2 — FDE install on the platform host (Debian 13, LUKS2 + dropbear remote unlock)

The relay host skips this step. Full detail in [`iso-install.md`](iso-install.md). The ordered essentials for 1984:

```bash
# from the repo root, on your workstation
bun run build:iso \
  --hostname llamenos-01 \
  --ssh-key ~/.ssh/<key>.pub \
  --disk /dev/vda \
  --static-ip <ipv4>/<prefix> \
  --gateway <gateway>
```

1984 does not run DHCP during install; without `--static-ip`/`--gateway` the
installer hangs silently at "Configure the network". Then: host the ISO at a
public HTTPS URL → support ticket to 1984 with the URL and the SHA-256 from
`dist/iso/*.sha256` → boot the VPS from it → in the noVNC console type the LUKS
passphrase when asked → wait for the install to finish and reboot → **detach the
ISO** in the panel.

Every boot then pauses in the initramfs. Unlock from your workstation:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 -i ~/.ssh/<key> root@<ipv4>     # prompts for the LUKS passphrase, then disconnects
```

(The login user is `root`, not `deploy`: dropbear runs a single forced command,
`cryptroot-unlock`. Dropbear's host key differs from the post-install sshd's —
expect a separate `known_hosts` entry.)

Once it has booted, confirm the installer's `deploy` user works:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key> deploy@<ipv4> 'sudo -n true && echo sudo-ok'
```

### Step 3 — Create the DNS records (before deploying)

Caddy obtains certificates by ACME on first start, and preflight refuses to
proceed if a name does not resolve to the host that serves it, so the records
must exist and have propagated **first**. See [DNS records](#5-dns-records) for
the table. **`push.` points at the relay host; every other name at the platform
host.**

```bash
for h in api.<domain> <domain> updates.<domain> releases.<domain>; do
  printf '%s -> ' "$h"; dig +short "$h" A          # expect the PLATFORM IPv4
done
printf 'push.llamenos-hotline.org -> '; dig +short push.llamenos-hotline.org A   # expect the RELAY IPv4
```

### Step 4 — Write the two config files

```bash
cd deploy/ansible
cp inventory-production.example.yml inventory-production.yml   # gitignored
cp vars-production.example.yml     vars-production.yml         # gitignored
$EDITOR inventory-production.yml vars-production.yml
```

Never edit the tracked `vars.yml` / `inventory.yml`: they are committed
placeholders/defaults. `vars-production.yml` is passed with `-e @…` (extra-vars
win over everything, including the tracked `vars.yml` that every playbook also
loads), and both filled-in files are covered by `deploy/ansible/.gitignore`.

**`inventory-production.yml` — per host** (`llamenos-platform1` and `llamenos-relay1`;
the group placement is already filled in: app/db/storage on the platform host,
`llamenos_ntfy` on the relay, a Caddy on each)

| Key | Platform (`llamenos-platform1`) | Relay (`llamenos-relay1`) |
|---|---|---|
| `ansible_host` | platform public IPv4 (an IP, not a hostname — preflight's DNS check compares against it) | relay public IPv4 |
| `ansible_user` | `deploy` (created by the installer ISO) | the sudo user you created in step 1 |
| `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` | private half of the key you gave `--ssh-key` | private half of the relay user's key |
| `ansible_port` | `22` for the first run; **changed to `ssh_port` after step 6** | same |
| `llamenos_disk_encrypted` | `true` | `false` — never change this to make an error go away; it is what keeps secrets off the relay |

**`vars-production.yml` — values you must fill in** (all secrets are shipped
empty so preflight fails loudly if one is forgotten):

| Key | Notes |
|---|---|
| `domain` | apex domain |
| `acme_email` | Let's Encrypt account email |
| `ssh_port` | template default `22022`. Avoid `2222` (the dropbear unlock port; different host key → constant host-key warnings) |
| `ssh_allowed_cidrs` | your admin egress IP(s) as CIDRs, e.g. `203.0.113.7/32` — the **only** sources UFW will let reach SSH. Preflight rejects placeholders. |
| `llamenos_app_image` | see next section |
| `hmac_secret` | `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `server_secret` | `openssl rand -hex 32` (exactly 64 hex chars) |
| `pg_password` | `openssl rand -base64 24` |
| `storage_access_key` / `storage_secret_key` | `openssl rand -hex 16` / `openssl rand -base64 24` |
| `backup_age_public_key` | public half of `age-keygen -o backup-key.txt`; **keep the private key off the server** |
| `admin_pubkey` *(optional)* | `bun run bootstrap-admin`; otherwise bootstrap the first admin from the desktop app |

Everything else (`webhook_base_url`, `updates_domain`, `releases_domain`,
service toggles, pinned Postgres/Caddy image digests) is derived or defaulted in
the template. `ntfy_domain` is set to `push.llamenos-hotline.org` (infrastructure
names live on `llamenos-hotline.org`); a self-hoster sets `push.<their domain>`. `just generate-secrets` prints a block of random
values you can paste from.

Encrypt it:

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt vars-production.yml     # asks for the vault password (twice)
ansible-vault view    vars-production.yml     # sanity-check it decrypts
```

#### What the vault password is for

It is the symmetric key that encrypts `vars-production.yml` **on your machine and
in git/CI storage** — that file holds every secret in the deployment (database
password, HMAC/server secrets, storage keys). It is used only by Ansible on the
control node to decrypt the vars at run time; it is never sent to the server. On
the server the secrets exist only as the rendered `0600` `.env` files under
`/opt/llamenos/services/*`. It does not protect the disk (that is the LUKS
passphrase) and it is not derived from anything: lose it and you cannot decrypt
`vars-production.yml` (you would regenerate and rotate the secrets). Keep it in a
password manager, out of the repo and out of shell history; pass it with
`--ask-vault-pass` interactively or `--vault-password-file` for automation. The
GitHub `deploy-prod.yml` workflow reads it from the `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD`
environment secret.

### Getting the app image onto the server

Pick one. Either way, put the resulting reference in `llamenos_app_image`.

**A. Build locally and load it over SSH — no registry, no third party.** Verified
2026-09-25: builds in ~4½ min, `linux/amd64`, ~1.2 GB (~400 MB gzipped), and
contains `bun` (the container healthcheck uses it). **Pass `--target app`**: the
Dockerfile's last stage is the Caddy `static` image, and Docker builds the last
stage when none is named.

```bash
# repo root
docker build -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile --target app -t llamenos:<version> .
```

The server has no Docker until `harden.yml` has run (step 6), so load the image
*after* step 6 and *before* step 7:

```bash
docker save llamenos:<version> | gzip \
  | ssh -p <ssh_port> -i ~/.ssh/<key> deploy@<ipv4> 'docker load'
```

Use a bare `llamenos:<version>` tag. It resolves to Docker Hub's reserved
`library/` namespace, which nobody can register; never use `<someuser>/llamenos`
for a tag that is not actually published, because the role runs a `pull: always`
(errors ignored) before starting and would fetch whatever that namespace serves.

**B. Publish to a registry.** `.github/workflows/docker.yml` builds and pushes
`<DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/llamenos:<version>` (with SBOM, SLSA provenance, cosign
signature, Trivy scan), but it needs the `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`/`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`
secrets and a successful run first. After that, pin by digest:
`llamenos_app_image: docker.io/<user>/llamenos:<version>@sha256:…`.

### Step 5 — Preflight (still on port 22, before any change to the server)

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/preflight.yml \
  -i inventory-production.yml -e @vars-production.yml -e deployment_profile=official \
  --ask-vault-pass
```

Checks, on both hosts: the distribution (Debian ≥ 12 or Ubuntu 22.04/24.04),
ansible-core ≥ 2.18 on your workstation, SSH reachability, disk/RAM, every
required variable and secret length, that demo/dev settings are off, that
`ssh_allowed_cidrs` are real CIDRs, **that each host declares
`llamenos_disk_encrypted` and that nothing holding secrets at rest is placed on
the relay** ([the tier guard](#2-two-hosts-two-tiers)), and — because the profile
is `official` — that the names **each host's** Caddy will serve resolve to that
host: `api.<domain>`, the apex, `updates.` and `releases.` to the platform host,
`push.llamenos-hotline.org` to the relay. A `push.` record left pointing at the
platform host fails here. Fix everything it reports before continuing.

### Step 6 — Harden (**always before deploy**)

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/harden.yml \
  -i inventory-production.yml -e @vars-production.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

Runs on **both hosts**, in order: `common` (packages, chrony, unattended upgrades, `deploy` user),
`ssh-hardening`, `firewall` (UFW: deny-all + SSH on `ssh_port` from
`ssh_allowed_cidrs`, 80, 443/tcp, 443/udp), `kernel-hardening`, `fail2ban`,
`docker` (Docker CE, userns-remap, networks `llamenos-web`/`llamenos-internal`),
`security-scan`. Tags: `common ssh firewall kernel fail2ban docker security-scan`
(all also tagged `harden`).

**sshd moves to `ssh_port` and the old port closes.** The playbook restarts sshd
on the new port *before* it touches the firewall so a failure part-way cannot
leave you behind a firewall that admits only a port nothing listens on. Your
Ansible session survives; new connections do not use port 22. Immediately, in a
**second terminal, with the first still open**:

```bash
ssh -p <ssh_port> -i ~/.ssh/<key> deploy@<platform-ipv4> 'echo reachable'
ssh -p <ssh_port> -i ~/.ssh/<key> <relay-user>@<relay-ipv4> 'echo reachable'
```

Then edit `inventory-production.yml`: `ansible_port: <ssh_port>` on **both** hosts. Every later
command depends on this. (This is why the first run must not use the one-shot
`setup.yml`/`just setup-all`: it would attempt the deploy plays on the old port.)

If you locked yourself out (wrong `ssh_allowed_cidrs`, changed IP), the only
recovery is the provider's remote console.

### Step 7 — Load the app image (if you chose option A above)

Run the `docker save … | ssh … docker load` command from the image section now,
against the **platform** host only (the relay never runs the app).

### Step 8 — Deploy

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml \
  -i inventory-production.yml -e @vars-production.yml -e deployment_profile=official \
  --ask-vault-pass
```

One run deploys both hosts; each service role runs only on the hosts of its
inventory group. Order: service discovery (points the platform's `NTFY_URL` at
`https://push.llamenos-hotline.org`) → (internal TLS, off) → Docker →
**Postgres → RustFS** (platform) and **ntfy** (relay — mints the publish token and
hands it to the platform host) → **app** (platform) → **Caddy** on each host,
serving only its own names (+ whisper/asterisk/signal only if enabled) →
watchdog, NTP monitor, maintenance. Single-service reruns use tags: `postgres`,
`rustfs`, `ntfy`, `app`, `caddy`, `update-server`, `watchdog`, `ntp`,
`maintenance`, `docker`, `service-discovery`, `deploy`.

(Equivalent one-shot for *later* runs, once `ansible_port` is correct:
`./deploy/scripts/deploy-official.sh` runs `setup.yml` = preflight + harden +
deploy + smoke-check with the same flags.)

### Step 9 — Smoke check and verify

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/smoke-check.yml \
  -i inventory-production.yml -e @vars-production.yml -e deployment_profile=official \
  --ask-vault-pass
```

Each probe runs on the host its service lives on; both hosts also fetch
`https://push.llamenos-hotline.org/v1/health` over public DNS and TLS — the path the
app publishes through. Then, from your workstation:

```bash
curl -fsS https://api.<domain>/api/health/ready
curl -fsS https://updates.<domain>/health            # "ok"
curl -fsS https://push.llamenos-hotline.org/v1/health  # {"healthy":true}
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -d x https://push.llamenos-hotline.org/some-topic   # 403: anonymous publish refused
```

Repeat the certificate check below for `push.llamenos-hotline.org`: Android's
distributor connects there.

**Verify the certificate chain is ISRG-rooted** — the check that decides whether
Android can connect:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect api.<domain>:443 -servername api.<domain> -showcerts </dev/null 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -E '^( [0-9] s:|   i:)'
# leaf issuer must be a "Let's Encrypt" intermediate (R*/E*); the chain must
# terminate at ISRG Root X1 or X2. Anything else (ZeroSSL, Cloudflare, a
# provider CA) means TLS is not terminating where it must.
```

Caddy is configured with `acme_ca` set to Let's Encrypt only. (Caddy's default
would fall back to ZeroSSL when Let's Encrypt fails or rate-limits, whose chain
is not pinned — the fallback would look healthy in a browser and be a total
outage on Android. This was verified by adapting the Caddyfile: default = two
issuers, `acme_ca` = one.)

### Step 10 — Backups

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/backup.yml \
  -i inventory-production.yml -e @vars-production.yml --ask-vault-pass    # runs once and installs the cron schedule
ansible-playbook playbooks/backup-status.yml \
  -i inventory-production.yml -e @vars-production.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

When you have a moment: `playbooks/test-restore.yml` (non-destructive restore
test) and `playbooks/dr-test.yml`.

### Day 2

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/update.yml   -i inventory-production.yml -e @vars-production.yml --ask-vault-pass   # health-gated rolling update
ansible-playbook playbooks/rollback.yml -i inventory-production.yml -e @vars-production.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

**After every reboot** the platform host waits in the initramfs: `ssh -p 2222 root@<platform-ipv4>`
and type the LUKS passphrase (step 2). Nothing else comes up until you do. The
relay host reboots unattended — and so keeps Android wake-ups flowing only if
the platform is up to publish them.

`update.yml`, `rollback.yml`, `backup.yml`, `restore.yml` and `observability.yml`
skip the relay host (they keep data at rest). Update ntfy on the relay with
`playbooks/deploy.yml --tags ntfy`; rotate its publish token as in
`roles/llamenos-ntfy/README.md` ("Rotating the publish token").

## 5. DNS records

Create these at your DNS host **before** deploying. **DNS-only — do not proxy
them** (requirement (b) above). All are `A` records (add `AAAA` for each only if
that VPS has IPv6 and you have confirmed it is reachable); suggested TTL 300,
lower to 60 before any migration. **Two different targets:** everything points at
the platform host except `push.`, which points at the relay host.

| Name | `A` → | Purpose | Required when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api.<domain>` | **platform** IPv4 | The app: API, WebSocket, telephony/messaging webhooks. `webhook_base_url` points here. | Always |
| `<domain>` (apex) | **platform** IPv4 | Caddy serves a redirect to `api.<domain>` and requests a certificate for it | Always (preflight checks it; a missing record makes Caddy retry failing ACME orders) |
| `updates.<domain>` | **platform** IPv4 | Desktop auto-updater manifest: `https://updates.<domain>/desktop/latest.json` | `llamenos_update_server_enabled` (official profile) |
| `releases.<domain>` | **platform** IPv4 | Desktop updater artifacts (same tree; `tauri.conf.json` lists both hosts) | official profile |
| `push.llamenos-hotline.org` (`ntfy_domain`) | **relay** IPv4 — *not* the platform | ntfy / UnifiedPush broker. **Android has no FCM by design; without this, Android devices cannot be rung.** Only the relay's Caddy requests its certificate; a record pointing at the platform fails preflight and ACME | `llamenos_ntfy_enabled` (on in the template) |

For the official deployment the records to create are therefore:

```
api.<domain>                A   <platform IPv4>
<domain>                    A   <platform IPv4>
updates.<domain>            A   <platform IPv4>
releases.<domain>           A   <platform IPv4>
push.llamenos-hotline.org   A   <relay IPv4>
```

**Names your brief may have listed that nothing serves:** `app.` and `relay.`.
No role, Caddy vhost or health check in `deploy/ansible/` answers on either, and
`relay.` is treated as an *unrelated sibling origin* in the desktop network
guard tests (`apps/desktop/src/net.rs`). Do not create them unless you also add a
vhost. (`app.llamenos.org` still appears as a default CORS origin and in some
sample URLs; this deployment serves the app on `api.<domain>` and clients enter
that hub URL.)

A separate change is moving these records to `llamenos-hotline.org`: the names
above except `push.` are relative to `domain`, and `tauri.conf.json`'s updater endpoints and
`scripts/generate-update-manifest.sh`'s default base URL are still hard-coded to
`llamenos.org`. Moving an existing zone: [`dns-migration.md`](../runbooks/dns-migration.md).

## 6. Serving desktop updates from this box

The GitHub Releases (`desktop-v<version>`, `android-v<version>`) always work and
need nothing from this box. The self-hosted origin is an *additional* channel for
the in-app updater.

### How it is served

`updates.<domain>` and `releases.<domain>` are vhosts of the single Caddy, which
bind-mounts `/opt/llamenos/services/update-server/artifacts` read-only at
`/srv/updates`. Layout (matches `tauri.conf.json` endpoints and the URLs inside
the manifest):

```
artifacts/desktop/latest.json                # https://updates.<domain>/desktop/latest.json
artifacts/desktop/v<version>/<installer>     # https://releases.<domain>/desktop/v<version>/<installer>
artifacts/desktop/v<version>/<installer>.sig
```

Only `/desktop/*` and `/health` are served. (A previous version of this role ran
a second Caddy on `127.0.0.1:3080/3443`: it could never complete ACME, nothing
routed public traffic to it, and it crash-looped on `read_only: true` — verified.
It is gone.) Populate the directory as in
[`desktop-update-release.md`](../runbooks/desktop-update-release.md).

### What RustFS needs — report

`.github/workflows/tauri-release.yml` publishes to a **second channel only when
all five secrets are set** (none set → skipped cleanly; some but not all →
the job fails; that is intentional). What they must contain:

| Secret | Contents |
|---|---|
| `RUSTFS_ENDPOINT` | An S3 endpoint **reachable from GitHub-hosted runners over the internet**. The RustFS on this box is deliberately private (Docker network only, no published port), so this cannot be it as deployed. |
| `RUSTFS_ACCESS_KEY` / `RUSTFS_SECRET_KEY` | S3 credentials with write access to the bucket below. |
| `RUSTFS_STAGING_BUCKET` | Bucket **name** (no default; the workflow does not create it). |
| `RELEASES_REPO_PAT` | Fine-grained PAT with write access to the GitHub repo `rhonda-rodododo/llamenos-releases`. |

Written by CI (`aws s3 cp --endpoint-url $RUSTFS_ENDPOINT`):

```
s3://<RUSTFS_STAGING_BUCKET>/desktop/v<version>/<every installer, .sig, CHECKSUMS…>
s3://<RUSTFS_STAGING_BUCKET>/desktop/v<version>/latest.json
s3://<RUSTFS_STAGING_BUCKET>/desktop/latest.json
```

**This is the same `desktop/…` tree the Caddy vhost serves from disk**, so CI's
output is directly usable — the missing piece is only how the bytes get from the
bucket to the box's filesystem, and that is a choice:

1. **Recommended: leave the five secrets unset**, and publish to the box by
   `rsync` over SSH (the documented manual path). No public S3 endpoint, so
   RustFS stays private; the GitHub Release stays the automated channel.
2. Expose RustFS's S3 API publicly (a vhost with the original `Host` header
   preserved — SigV4 signs it) so CI can write and Caddy can proxy reads from a
   public-read prefix. Works, but publishes the object store's API to the
   internet on a deployment whose threat model includes well-funded adversaries.
   Not done here.

**Is the `llamenos-releases` metadata repo still required?** *As the workflow is
written, yes* — `RELEASES_REPO_PAT` is one of the five, the "push access" probe
runs before any upload, and `verify-release-live.yml`, `verify-build.sh`, the
release notes and `site/src/config.ts` read checksums/SBOM from it. It holds
`desktop/v<version>/{CHECKSUMS.txt,sbom-desktop.cdx.json,build-info.json,latest.json}`
— a public transparency log, not something the updater needs. **It could be
replaced by the self-hosted tree** (those four files are already generated and
could sit beside the installers under `desktop/v<version>/`), but that means
changing the workflow and its four consumers — a separate change. Nothing was
changed here.

### Two defects that block the updater channel regardless of hosting

Reproduced against the real `desktop-v0.19.16` release assets:

* **`scripts/generate-update-manifest.sh` emits `"platforms": {}`.** It looks for
  `*.app.tar.gz.sig`, `*.nsis.zip.sig`, `*.AppImage.tar.gz.sig`; the release ships
  `Hotline_0.19.16_amd64.AppImage.sig`, `Hotline_0.19.16_x64-setup.exe.sig`,
  `Hotline_0.19.16_x64_en-US.msi.sig` (and `.deb`/`.rpm`). The workflow's own
  "Verify latest.json covers every platform" step would fail the job once the
  channel is enabled. Needs a fix in `scripts/` (and macOS is excluded from the
  release until Apple signing lands).
* **Base URL is not set by the workflow.** `RUSTFS_PUBLIC_URL` is read by the
  script but never provided, so URLs default to `https://releases.llamenos.org`.
  It must be set to `https://releases.<domain>` (a repository variable) once the
  domain is decided, together with `tauri.conf.json`'s `endpoints`.

Signatures are minisign over the installers, verified by the app against the
pubkey embedded in `tauri.conf.json`, so a compromised or misconfigured host
cannot push a malicious update — but it can strand users on an old version.

## What only a real server will prove

Everything below was **not** exercisable without a host. It is listed so the first
real run knows where to look:

* The FDE install itself and dropbear unlock (verified on 1984 on 2026-04-19, not re-run here).
* `harden.yml` end to end: UFW enable, sysctl (`net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max`
  needs the `nf_conntrack` module loaded; the firewall role runs first and
  normally loads it), fail2ban, userns-remap Docker restart.
* Real ACME issuance and the ISRG chain check above; Let's Encrypt rate limits if DNS is wrong.
* The `deploy.yml` role sequence against real Docker (compose files were rendered and
  `docker compose config`-validated; the Caddyfile was validated and the updates
  vhost was served and probed in a local Caddy container).
* Any provider-specific quirk (1984 support turnaround for the ISO; static-IP details).
* The two-host run: the platform app publishing to `https://push.llamenos-hotline.org`
  with the token handed over from the relay; the relay's Caddy obtaining its
  certificate; the post-start `auth.db`-only volume check and the adapted-Caddyfile
  log-policy check on the relay (both were exercised locally against the pinned
  ntfy and Caddy images, not through the roles on a real host).
* FlokiNET's stock Debian image under `harden.yml` (never run there).

## What was validated without a server (2026-09-25)

* `ansible-playbook --syntax-check` on all 19 playbooks + `setup.yml`; `ansible-lint --profile min .` (the CI bar) passes.
* Every role referenced by `deploy.yml`, `harden.yml`, `setup.yml` exists.
* `scripts/check-required-env.py`: both `.env` templates render every var the worker requires.
* Preflight run end to end against a local target with the production layering
  (tracked `vars.yml` + `-e @vars-production…`): passes with valid input; fails with
  the intended message for a placeholder CIDR and for a DNS mismatch.
* Debian 13 rehearsal in a `debian:trixie` container: found and fixed the Docker
  apt repository (was hard-coded to Ubuntu), `software-properties-common` (absent
  from Debian 13), and unattended-upgrades origin patterns (matched nothing on Debian);
  the SSH hardening drop-in passes `sshd -t` on OpenSSH 10.0.
* The app's rendered `.env` now carries `NTFY_PUBLIC_URL=https://<ntfy_domain>`. Without it
  `apps/worker/lib/ntfy-origin.ts` rejects every Android device endpoint (only `NTFY_URL`
  = the internal `http://ntfy:80` was trusted), so Android devices could never be rung.
* `tofu validate` on `deploy/opentofu` (was failing; fixed).
* The app image builds (`--target app`) and contains `bun`.
* Two-tier layout: `scripts/check-disk-tier-guards.py` (22 cases) — every preflight
  tier refusal, the ntfy persistence guard, the Caddy log-policy assertion (Caddy
  adapts the rendered Caddyfile), the per-host Caddy vhosts, the per-host DNS check
  and the skip in backup/restore/update/rollback/observability, each on the good
  layout and on the injected defect.
* Service placement across hosts: the roles skipped foreign hosts with `meta: end_play`,
  which Ansible evaluates for the **first** host only and then applies to all. With
  the platform host listed first, a `deploy.yml` run put PostgreSQL on **both** hosts
  and ntfy on **neither** (reproduced by the gating case of the script above with
  `end_play` restored). All roles now use `meta: end_role` (per host).
* `deploy.yml` failed at its first play on every run: `roles/service-discovery`
  printed an undefined `llamenos_relay_url` (the Nostr relay was removed long ago).
  Fixed.
* ntfy v2.11.0 (pinned digest), run locally with the role's settings: at INFO it logs
  nothing per publish/subscribe/rejected token but a per-minute stats line; at WARN,
  nothing; `/var/lib/ntfy` holds only `auth.db`; rotating the publish token gives the
  old token 401, the new one 200, and anonymous subscribers are unaffected.
* Caddy 2.9 (pinned digest): a `reverse_proxy` error is logged with the client IP,
  `X-Forwarded-For` and the URI (the topic) by default; with the relay's log filter,
  none of the three appear.
