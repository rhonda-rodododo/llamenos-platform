## Development Workflow

New feature development follows the superpowers workflow:

1. **Brainstorm** (`superpowers:brainstorming`) → spec in `docs/superpowers/specs/`
2. **Plan** (`superpowers:writing-plans`) → plan in `docs/superpowers/plans/`
3. **Execute** (`superpowers:executing-plans`) → implementation in a worktree

See `CLAUDE.md` for the full development workflow.
