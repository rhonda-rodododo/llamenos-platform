# Official Server Deployment Guide

## Purpose

Deploy the Llamenos project's production servers: the platform host on 1984 Hosting (Iceland; full-disk encryption) with the app, PostgreSQL, RustFS, Caddy and the desktop update origin (`updates.`/`releases.`), and the ntfy push relay on its own unencrypted FlokiNET host (see [Two hosts, two tiers](../deployment/first-deploy.md#2-two-hosts-two-tiers)). Monitoring and the Signal notifier are opt-in (`observability_enabled`, `llamenos_signal_enabled`).

> **First deploy on a fresh VPS?** Follow [`docs/deployment/first-deploy.md`](../deployment/first-deploy.md)
> — the full ordered sequence (FDE install → DNS → config → preflight → harden →
> deploy → smoke-check → backups). This runbook covers the official profile
> once the box exists and `ansible_port` already matches the hardened `ssh_port`.

## Prerequisites

- **Platform VPS:** provisioned per [`iso-install.md`](../deployment/iso-install.md) (Debian 13, FDE, dropbear unlock), `llamenos_disk_encrypted: true`; **relay VPS:** stock Debian, `llamenos_disk_encrypted: false`; `playbooks/harden.yml` already run on both
- **DNS:** DNS-only (unproxied) `A` records for `api.`, the apex, `updates.` and `releases.` under your domain pointing at the **platform** VPS, and `push.llamenos-hotline.org` pointing at the **relay** VPS (preflight checks each host's names). TLS terminates on the VPS with a Let's Encrypt cert — the Android client hard-fails on any other chain (see first-deploy.md §1, §4)
- **App image:** `llamenos_app_image` set to an image that exists (the vars.yml default `docker.io/llamenos/llamenos:latest` is not published — first-deploy.md, "Getting the app image onto the server")
- **Ansible Vault:** password shared among maintainers via a secure channel

### Required GitHub Secrets (production environment) — for the CI deploy only

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `PROD_INVENTORY_YML` | Content of `inventory-production.yml` (both hosts: IPs, SSH port/user, `llamenos_disk_encrypted`) |
| `PROD_VARS_YML_ENCRYPTED` | Content of the vault-encrypted `vars-production.yml` |
| `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD` | Vault decryption password |
| `PROD_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | SSH key for the deploy user — the workflow installs this one key, so it must be authorized on **both** hosts |

## Steps

### First-time configuration

```bash
cd deploy/ansible
cp vars-production.example.yml     vars-production.yml       # gitignored; fill in — see the file's comments
cp inventory-production.example.yml inventory-production.yml  # gitignored; ansible_host, key, ansible_port
ansible-vault encrypt vars-production.yml
```

The templates carry no secrets; every secret is empty so preflight fails loudly
if one is forgotten. Which value goes where, and what the vault password is for:
first-deploy.md, step 4.

### Deploy

```bash
./deploy/scripts/deploy-official.sh          # setup.yml: preflight + harden + deploy + smoke-check
./deploy/scripts/deploy-official.sh --tags app   # single service
```

Or via CI: run the `Deploy Production` workflow from GitHub Actions. On a **fresh**
VPS do not start here: `harden.yml` moves sshd off port 22 and the inventory must
be updated between hardening and deploying (first-deploy.md, step 6).

### Subsequent updates

Via CI (recommended): GitHub Actions > Deploy Production > Run workflow

Via CLI: `./deploy/scripts/deploy-official.sh`, or the health-gated
`ansible-playbook playbooks/update.yml -i inventory-production.yml -e @vars-production.yml --ask-vault-pass`

## Verification

```bash
# API health
curl https://api.<domain>/api/health/ready

# Update server
curl https://updates.<domain>/health

# Desktop update manifest
curl https://updates.<domain>/desktop/latest.json   # 404 until a release has been published to the box (desktop-update-release.md)
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Vault password error | Wrong password | Verify with `ansible-vault view vars-production.yml` |
| DNS preflight fails | Records not propagated | `dig +short api.<domain>` — wait for propagation |
| `updates.` returns 404/502 | Caddy not running, or artifacts not uploaded | `ssh -p <ssh_port> deploy@<ip> docker compose -f /opt/llamenos/services/caddy/docker-compose.yml ps`; artifacts live in `/opt/llamenos/services/update-server/artifacts/desktop/` |
