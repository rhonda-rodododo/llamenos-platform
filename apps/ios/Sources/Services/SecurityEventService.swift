/// Events are persisted to disk immediately on `report(_:)` — synchronously, before

/// uploaded to the server in batches, in both debug AND release builds, with
/// exponential backoff on failure. Upload failures never throw, block, or crash
/// the caller; a failed batch just stays queued for the next attempt.
///
/// ## Why this can't be blocked by the pinning failure it reports
///
/// `report(.certPinMismatch)` is called from `CertificatePinningDelegate` at the
/// exact moment a TLS handshake failed pin validation. If event upload reused the
/// app's normal pinned `URLSession`, a persistent pin mismatch (e.g. the intended
/// threat model: a MITM presenting a certificate we correctly refuse) would also
/// break every future upload attempt — the one report that most needs to reach the
/// server would be the one report that can never leave the device.
///
/// To avoid this, `uploadSession` is a **separate** `URLSession` with no custom
/// `URLSessionDelegate` at all — it falls back to the OS's standard TLS trust
/// evaluation (a valid, publicly-trusted certificate chain), not this deployment's
/// pinned SPKI hashes. This is a narrow, deliberate exception to certificate
/// pinning, scoped ONLY to this one reporting channel:
/// - It still requires a certificate the device's trust store accepts, so a
///   passive network attacker without a trusted CA cannot intercept the report.
/// - It reports exactly the failure that would otherwise go unreported: a pin
///   mismatch caused by a legitimate (but unexpected) CA rotation, OR by an
///   active MITM — either way, an admin needs to see it to tell the two apart.
/// - It never carries the credentials or content that pinning exists to protect
///   (auth tokens, note/message plaintext); it carries only the fields on
///   `SecurityEventUploadItem`.
