# Classifies a list of changed files into the platform/scope flags CI uses to
# decide which jobs a PR's changes actually need.
#
# This is the SINGLE source of truth for the platform path map. Before this
# script existed, the same map was maintained independently in three places
# that had already drifted from each other: ci.yml's `changes` job (an
# `android` regex only), desktop-e2e.yml's `on.pull_request.paths:` list, and
# ios-e2e.yml's own `ios_related` regex. Extending or fixing platform scope
# happens HERE, once — every workflow that needs it calls this script instead
# of re-deriving its own copy (see #664).
#
# Usage: printf '%s\n' "$CHANGED_FILES" | detect-changed-platforms.sh
# Reads the changed-file list (one path per line) from stdin. Emits one
# `key=value` line per flag on stdout — safe to redirect straight into
# $GITHUB_OUTPUT, or to capture and parse in a test.

# Any file under one of these paths is reachable from every platform's build
# — a change here must run every platform's tests, not just whichever tree
# it happens to live in. Deliberately narrower than "everything that isn't
# docs": apps/worker/** (backend) is NOT here — it is its own `backend`
# platform below — so a pure backend change no longer drags in Android/iOS
# builds the way the old per-workflow regexes did (that coupling was part of
# the over-triggering #664 exists to fix).
#
# .github/scripts/detect-changed-platforms.sh (this file) is included here
# too: it is the single thing that decides every other flag below, so a
# change to it gets the same "run everything" treatment as ci.yml itself —
# anything narrower risks a broken rewrite of this script shipping with its
# own blast radius silently gated to `false`.

# src/server/ is the actual Bun server entry point (`bun run build:server`,
# and the image `docker compose ... up --build` produces for e2e/backend-bdd/
# android-e2e) — it lives outside apps/worker/ but is exactly as
# backend-relevant. drizzle/ (migration files + snapshots) and
# drizzle.config.ts are the literal inputs `bun run migration:check` (the
# migration-drift job) diffs, and backend-bdd applies these migrations via
# the bootstrapped backend — both need the `backend` flag, not just
# migration-drift. tests/steps/backend/ is backend-bdd's own step
# definitions (playwright.config.ts's `backend-bdd` project points its
# `steps` glob there specifically, distinct from the desktop `bdd` project's
# steps) — already caught by the blanket `tests/` prefix below for the
# `desktop` flag, but backend-bdd itself only gates on `backend`, so it needs
# its own hit here too.

CRYPTO_RE='^packages/crypto/'
ANSIBLE_RE='^deploy/ansible/'
# Dependency manifests only — deliberately narrower than SHARED_DEPS_RE: a
# docs- or workflow-only PR must not be blocked by a dependency advisory it
# could not possibly have introduced.
AUDIT_RE='^(package\.json$|bun\.lock)'
# The fleet orchestrator has no backend/DB dependency and its safety-rail
# tests run inside the backend-unit job (see that job's own comment in
# ci.yml) — its own source and tests must gate that job too, independent of
# the `backend` flag.
ORCHESTRATOR_RE='^(orchestrator/|tests/orchestrator/|vitest\.orchestrator\.config\.ts$)'
# The cross-platform BDD feature corpus (packages/test-specs/features/**)
# and the one composite action every backend-bootstrapping job shares
# (.github/actions/bootstrap-backend) — both are read directly by ci.yml's
# `e2e` (desktop bdd + backend-bdd Playwright projects), `backend-bdd`, and
# `android-e2e` (collects `packages/test-specs/features/platform/mobile/**`
# into androidTest assets) jobs, and by desktop-e2e.yml's own `test` job
# (also bootstraps via the same action). None of the three platform-specific
# regexes above would catch either path on its own, so a change here sets
# `desktop`, `backend`, AND `android` directly rather than relying on one of
# them to coincidentally already be true.
E2E_INFRA_RE='^(packages/test-specs/|\.github/actions/)'
# playwright.config.ts is read directly by ci.yml's `e2e` job and by
# desktop-e2e.yml's `test` job (both invoke `bunx playwright test` against
# it) — not by android/ios, which don't use Playwright at all.
