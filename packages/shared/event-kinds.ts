/**
 * Event kind definitions for Llamenos server-published events.
 *
 * Kind ranges:
 *   - Regular events (1000-9999): persisted in ring buffer, replayed on reconnect
 *   - Ephemeral events (20000-29999): not persisted, broadcast only
 *
 * All server-published events are signed with the server Ed25519 keypair
 * (derived from SERVER_SECRET). Clients verify signatures against the
 * server's pubkey (fetched from /api/config).
