Feature: Security Audit Coverage (Rounds 4-8)
  As the server
  I want all security audit fixes to be verified
  So that regressions are caught immediately

  # ── Round 4 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Scenario: Vonage webhook rejects missing HMAC signature
    Given a Vonage webhook request without a signature parameter
    When the webhook validation runs
    Then the request should be rejected

  Scenario: Vonage webhook rejects expired timestamp
    Given a Vonage webhook request with a timestamp older than 5 minutes
    When the webhook validation runs
    Then the request should be rejected as replay

  Scenario: Volunteer self-update rejects role escalation fields
    Given a volunteer PATCH request with "roles" set to admin
    When the update is processed
    Then the "roles" field should be stripped from the update

  Scenario: Security headers are present on all API responses
    When a client makes any API request
    Then the response should include COOP, Referrer-Policy, and X-Content-Type-Options headers

  # ── Round 5 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Scenario: Login endpoint verifies Schnorr signature
    Given a login request with a valid pubkey but no Schnorr signature
    When the login is processed
    Then the server should reject the request

  Scenario: CAPTCHA digits are not exposed in URL parameters
    Given a CAPTCHA challenge is generated
    Then the expected digits should not appear in any URL or response body
    And the digits should be stored server-side only

  Scenario: Invite redemption requires proof of private key
    Given an invite code exists
    When someone tries to redeem it without a Schnorr signature
    Then the redemption should fail with 400

  Scenario: Upload chunk endpoint enforces ownership
    Given volunteer A uploads a file chunk
    When volunteer B tries to access volunteer A's upload status
    Then the request should be rejected with 403

  Scenario: Sessions are revoked on volunteer deactivation
    Given a volunteer with an active session
    When the volunteer is deactivated by an admin
    Then the volunteer's session tokens should be invalidated

  Scenario: Reporter role cannot create call notes
    Given a user with reporter role
    When they attempt to create a call note
    Then the server should reject with 403

  # ── Round 6 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Scenario: Dev reset requires DEV_RESET_SECRET when configured
    Given the DEV_RESET_SECRET environment variable is set
    When a reset request is made without the X-Test-Secret header
    Then the reset should be rejected

  Scenario: SSRF blocklist rejects IPv4-mapped IPv6 private addresses
    Given a provider test URL of "http://[::ffff:127.0.0.1]/api"
    When the SSRF guard evaluates the URL
    Then it should be blocked as an internal address

  Scenario: Phone hashing uses HMAC-SHA256, not bare SHA-256
    Given a phone number "+15551234567"
    When it is hashed with two different HMAC secrets
    Then the hashes should be different

  Scenario: Admin pubkey not exposed in public config
    When the public /api/config endpoint is queried
    Then the response should not contain adminPubkey

  # ── Round 7 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Scenario: Invite creation blocks privilege escalation
    Given a volunteer-permissioned user
    When they try to create an invite with admin role
    Then the server should reject with 403 citing missing permissions

  Scenario: Nostr relay events are encrypted
    Given a hub with SERVER_NOSTR_SECRET configured
    When the server publishes a Nostr event
    Then the event content should be encrypted with the derived event key

  Scenario: Auth tokens without method+path binding are rejected
    Given a Schnorr token signed without method and path
    When it is presented to an API endpoint
    Then the server should reject with 401

  Scenario: Contact identifiers are encrypted at rest
    Given a new conversation with phone "+15551234567"
    When the conversation is stored
    Then the stored phone value should start with "enc:"

  Scenario: BlastDO subscriber hashing uses HMAC_SECRET
    Given HMAC_SECRET is set to a unique value
    When a subscriber phone is hashed for the blast list
    Then the hash should depend on HMAC_SECRET, not a public constant

  # ── Round 8 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Scenario: serverEventKeyHex is not in public config
    When the unauthenticated /api/config endpoint is queried
    Then the response should not contain serverEventKeyHex

  Scenario: serverEventKeyHex is available after authentication
    Given an authenticated user
    When they query /api/auth/me
    Then the response should contain serverEventKeyHex

  Scenario: DEMO_MODE=false prevents DO reset in production
    Given DEMO_MODE is set to "false"
    When a reset request is sent to any Durable Object
    Then the reset should be rejected

  Scenario: Hub slug must match pattern
    When creating a hub with slug "-invalid-slug-"
    Then the server should reject with a validation error

  Scenario: Blast mediaUrl must use HTTPS
    When creating a blast with mediaUrl "http://cdn.example.com/image.jpg"
    Then the server should reject with a validation error about HTTPS

  Scenario: Upload size is capped at 10MB
    When uploading a file of 11MB
    Then the server should reject with 413 Payload Too Large
