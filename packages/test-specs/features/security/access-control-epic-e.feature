Feature: Backend access control and input validation (Epic E)
  Surgical fixes for seven backend security vulnerabilities identified in the
  2026-05-18 security audit: co-approver admin check (H01), cross-hub IDOR on
  records/by-contact, account-lockdown re-auth, blast input sanitization (H02),
  SSRF fail-closed on DNS failure (H07), and PUK envelope race condition (H09).

  # ── H01: Co-approver must be a registered admin device ────────────────────

  @backend
  Scenario: Erasure co-approver with volunteer role is rejected
    Given a registered volunteer user with pubkey "vol-pk-1"
    And a registered admin user with pubkey "admin-pk-1"
    When "vol-pk-1" submits an emergency erasure request
    And the co-approver signature is made by "vol-pk-1" (a volunteer, not an admin)
    Then the response status is 403
    And the error mentions co-approver must be an admin

  @backend
  Scenario: Erasure co-approver with hub-admin role is accepted
    Given a registered admin user with pubkey "admin-pk-1" and role "role-hub-admin"
    And a registered volunteer user with pubkey "vol-pk-2"
    When "vol-pk-2" submits an emergency erasure request
    And the co-approver signature is made by "admin-pk-1" (a hub admin)
    Then the response status is 201

  @backend
  Scenario: Erasure co-approver with unknown pubkey is rejected
    Given no user is registered with pubkey "unknown-pk-1"
    When a volunteer submits an emergency erasure request
