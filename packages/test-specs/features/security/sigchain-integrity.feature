Feature: Sigchain Integrity
  As the key management system
  I want to maintain tamper-evident, hash-chained device authorization records
  So that device compromise cannot silently rewrite history

  Background:
    Given a registered user with a known keypair

  @backend
  Scenario: Append a valid genesis link to an empty sigchain
    When the user appends a genesis sigchain link
    Then the response status is 201
    And the sigchain has 1 link
    And the first link has linkType "genesis"

  @backend
  Scenario: Append a device_add link after genesis
    Given the user has a genesis sigchain link
    When the user appends a "device_add" link with valid prevHash
    Then the response status is 201
    And the sigchain has 2 links

  @backend
  Scenario: Reject link with invalid signature
    Given the user has a genesis sigchain link
    When the user appends a link with an invalid Ed25519 signature
    Then the response status is 400

  @backend
  Scenario: Reject link that breaks hash chain
    Given the user has a genesis sigchain link
    When the user appends a link with wrong prevHash
    Then the response status is 409

  @backend
  Scenario: Reject duplicate seqNo
    Given the user has a genesis sigchain link
    When the user appends a link with duplicate seqNo 0
    Then the response status is 409

  @backend
  Scenario: Only the owner can append to their sigchain
    Given a second registered user
    When the second user tries to append to the first user's sigchain
    Then the response status is 403

  @backend
  Scenario: Admin can read another user's sigchain
    Given the user has a genesis sigchain link
    When the admin reads the user's sigchain
    Then the response status is 200
    And the sigchain has 1 link

  @backend
  Scenario: Volunteer cannot read another user's sigchain
    Given a second registered user
    When the second user tries to read the first user's sigchain
    Then the response status is 403
