Feature: Entity System Unification
  Events are records. Entity type templates provide preconfigured starting points.
  Date and location fields use blind indexes for server-side filtering without
  revealing cleartext values.

  @templates
  Scenario: List builtin entity type templates
    Given I am authenticated as admin
    When I request GET /api/settings/cms/templates
    Then the response should contain 4 templates
    And the template list should include a template with category "event"
    And the template list should include a template with category "case"

  @templates
  Scenario: Apply event template creates entity type with date fields
    Given I am authenticated as admin
    And case management is enabled
    When I apply the builtin template "builtin:event"
    Then an entity type with category "event" should be created
    And that entity type should have a field named "start_date" with indexType "date"
    And that entity type should have a field named "location" with indexType "location"

  @templates
  Scenario: Template application is idempotent within a hub
    Given I am authenticated as admin
    And the builtin template "builtin:event" has been applied
    When I apply the builtin template "builtin:event" again
    Then only one entity type with templateId "builtin:event" should exist

  @blind-index @date
  Scenario: Date blind index tokens enable month-level filtering
    Given case management is enabled
    And an event entity type exists with start_date field (indexType=date)
    And a record exists with start_date blind indexes for "2026-05"
    And a record exists with start_date blind indexes for "2026-06"
    When I filter records by blindIndexToken "month:2026-05" on field "start_date"
    Then I should receive 1 record
    And the server should not have seen the plaintext date

  @permission-aliasing
  Scenario: events:read permission maps to cases:read
    Given a user has permission "events:read" but not "cases:read"
    When the user requests GET /api/records
    Then the request should be permitted
    And the audit log should show permission alias "events:read -> cases:read"

  @migration
  Scenario: Events migration status endpoint returns pending count
    Given case management is enabled
    And 3 events exist without deprecated_at set
    When I request GET /api/admin/events/migration-status
    Then the response should contain pendingCount 3

  @migration
  Scenario: Events migration marks events as deprecated
    Given case management is enabled
    And 2 events exist without deprecated_at set
    When I POST /api/admin/events/migrate
    Then all 2 events should have deprecated_at set
    And the response should contain migrated 2
