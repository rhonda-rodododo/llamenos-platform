Feature: Hub Management
  Admins can create, list, and switch between hubs.
  Each hub is an independent organizational unit with its own
  volunteers, shifts, and case data.

  # --- Backend API scenarios ---

  @backend
  Scenario: Create and list hubs via API
    And the admin creates a hub via API
    When the admin lists all hubs
    Then the hub list should contain at least 1 hub
    And each hub should have a name and slug

  @backend
  Scenario: Create hub returns correct data
    When the admin creates a hub with name "Test Hub" and slug "test-hub"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the created hub should have name "Test Hub"
    And the created hub should have slug "test-hub"
    And the hub should appear in the list

  # --- UI scenarios ---

    Given I am logged in as an admin
