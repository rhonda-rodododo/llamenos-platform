Feature: Note Encryption & Management
  As a volunteer
  I want to create, view, edit, and search encrypted notes
  So that call documentation is secure and accessible

  # ── Backend: Note Encryption ──────────────────────────────────────

  @backend
  Scenario: Note envelope has per-note random key
    Given a new note is created
    Then the envelope should contain a unique random symmetric key

  @backend
  Scenario: Note key is HPKE-wrapped for volunteer
    Given a note created by a volunteer
    Then the envelope should contain the key wrapped for the volunteer's pubkey

  @backend
  Scenario: Note key is HPKE-wrapped for each admin
    Given a hub with 3 admins
    When a note is created
    Then the envelope should contain 3 admin key wraps

  @backend
  Scenario: Note content is encrypted with AES-256-GCM
    Given an encrypted note envelope
    Then the ciphertext should be decryptable with the correct symmetric key

  @backend
  Scenario: Forward secrecy through unique keys
    Given two notes created by the same volunteer
    Then each note should have a different symmetric key

  @backend
  Scenario: Envelope format matches protocol specification
    Given an encrypted note envelope
    Then it should contain version, nonce, ciphertext, and reader keys fields
