    Given case management is enabled
    And an entity type "record_test_type" exists
    When the admin creates a record of type "record_test_type" with status hash "status_open_hash"
    Then the record should have a generated UUID id
    And the record should have entity type "record_test_type"
    And the record should have status hash "status_open_hash"

  @cases
  Scenario: List records filtered by entity type
    Given case management is enabled
    And an entity type "filter_type_a" exists
    And an entity type "filter_type_b" exists
    And a record of type "filter_type_a" exists
    And a record of type "filter_type_b" exists
    When the admin lists records filtered by entity type "filter_type_a"
    Then all returned records should have entity type "filter_type_a"

  @cases
  Scenario: Link contact to record with role
    Given case management is enabled

  Scenario: Generate case number with auto-increment
    Given case management is enabled

    When the admin creates a record of the numbered type
    Then the record should have a case number matching "RC-{year}-0001"
    When the admin creates another record of the numbered type
    Then the second record should have a case number matching "RC-{year}-0002"

  @cases
  Scenario: Update record status
    Given case management is enabled
    And an entity type "status_test_type" exists
    And a record of type "status_test_type" exists with status hash "status_open_hash"
    When the admin updates the record status hash to "status_closed_hash"
    Then the record should have status hash "status_closed_hash"

  @cases @permissions
  Scenario: Volunteer sees only assigned records
    Given case management is enabled
