Feature: Invite Lifecycle
  As an admin
  I want to create, validate, and redeem invite codes
  So that only authorized people can join the system

  @backend
  Scenario: Admin creates an invite
    Given I am logged in as an admin
    When the admin creates an invite for "New Volunteer" with phone "+15551234567"
    Then the response status is 201
    And the invite has a valid UUID code
    And the invite has an expiration date

  @backend
  Scenario: Validate a valid invite code
    Given I am logged in as an admin
    And an invite exists for "Val Test" with phone "+15551234568"
    When the invite code is validated
    Then the response status is 200
    And the invite is valid

  @backend
  Scenario: Validate a nonexistent invite code
    When a random UUID is validated as an invite
    Then the response status is 200
    And the invite is not valid with error "not_found"

  @backend
  Scenario: Redeem an invite to register a new user
    Given I am logged in as an admin
    And an invite exists for "Redeemer" with phone "+15551234569"
    When a new user redeems the invite
    Then the response status is 200

  @backend
  Scenario: Redeemed invite cannot be reused
    Given I am logged in as an admin
    And an invite exists for "Single Use" with phone "+15551234570"
    And the invite has been redeemed by a user
    When the invite code is validated
    Then the invite is not valid with error "already_used"

  @backend
  Scenario: Admin can list invites
    Given I am logged in as an admin
    And an invite exists for "List Test" with phone "+15551234571"
    When the admin lists invites
    Then the response status is 200
    And the invite list is not empty

  @backend
  Scenario: Admin can revoke an invite
    Given I am logged in as an admin
    And an invite exists for "Revoke Test" with phone "+15551234572"
    When the admin revokes the invite
    Then the response status is 200
    And the invite code is no longer valid

  @backend
  Scenario: Invite validation is rate limited
    When a client floods invite validation 10 times
    Then at least one response is 429

  @backend
  Scenario: Volunteer cannot create invites
    Given a registered volunteer user
    When the volunteer tries to create an invite
    Then the response status is 403
