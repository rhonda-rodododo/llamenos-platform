Feature: Call Routing & History
  As the call routing system
  I want calls to be routed to on-shift volunteers and history to be searchable
  So that callers are connected and records are maintained

  # ── Backend: Telephony Adapter ────────────────────────────────────

  @backend
  Scenario: Twilio adapter requires Account SID, Auth Token, and TwiML App SID
    Given a Twilio provider configuration
    When I validate with missing Account SID
    Then validation should fail with required field error

  @backend
  Scenario: SignalWire adapter requires Space URL and Project ID
    Given a SignalWire provider configuration
    When I validate with all required fields
    Then validation should pass

  @backend
  Scenario: Vonage adapter requires API Key and Secret
    Given a Vonage provider configuration
    When I validate with all required fields
    Then validation should pass

  @backend
  Scenario: Adapter factory returns correct provider type
    Given provider configurations for Twilio and SignalWire
    When the factory creates an adapter for "twilio"
    Then it should return a Twilio adapter instance

  @backend
  Scenario: Invalid provider type returns error
    When the factory is asked for an unknown provider
    Then it should return a configuration error

  @backend
  Scenario: Provider labels are human-readable
    Then each provider should have a display label and icon identifier

  # ── Backend: Shift Routing ────────────────────────────────────────

  @backend
  Scenario: Select ring group from active shift
    Given a shift is currently active with 3 volunteers
    When a call needs to be routed
    Then all 3 volunteers should be in the ring group

  @backend
  Scenario: Exclude busy volunteers from ring group
    Given a shift with 3 volunteers and 1 is on a call
    When a call needs to be routed
    Then only 2 volunteers should be in the ring group

  @backend
  Scenario: Fallback group used when no shift is active
    Given no shift is currently active
    And a fallback ring group is configured
    When a call needs to be routed
    Then the fallback group should be used

  @backend
  Scenario: Overlapping shifts merge volunteer pools
    Given two overlapping shifts with different volunteers
    When a call needs to be routed during the overlap
    Then volunteers from both shifts should be in the ring group

  @backend
  Scenario: Empty ring group returns no-volunteers-available
    Given no shift is active and no fallback is configured
    When a call needs to be routed
    Then the router should return a no-volunteers error

  @backend
  Scenario: Shift time zone is respected
    Given a shift configured for 9am-5pm in America/New_York
    When the current time is 10am Eastern
    Then the shift should be considered active
