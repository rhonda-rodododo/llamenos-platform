Feature: Provider Setup PBAC Permission Enforcement
  As a security-conscious admin
  I want provider setup endpoints to enforce PBAC permissions
  So that volunteers cannot access or modify provider configurations

  Scenario: Unauthenticated request to provider configure is rejected
    When I POST to configure provider "twilio" without authentication
    Then the provider setup response is 401

    Then the provider setup response is 401

  Scenario: Admin can access provider setup under hub scope
    Given I am a provider setup admin
    And a provider setup hub exists
    When I POST to configure provider "twilio" under that hub
    Then the provider configure response is 200

  Scenario: Hub-scoped configure stores config for that hub
    Given I am a provider setup admin
    And a provider setup hub exists
    When I POST to configure provider "twilio" under that hub
    And I GET the provider status for "twilio" under that hub
    Then the provider status is "connected"

    And the response contains ok=true
