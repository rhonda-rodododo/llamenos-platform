Feature: WebRTC & Call Preference Settings
  As an admin
  I want to configure WebRTC calling and call preferences
  So that volunteers can take calls directly in the browser

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as an admin

  # --- Volunteer Settings: Call Preference ---

  Scenario: Call preference section is visible in volunteer settings
    When I navigate to the "Settings" page
    And I expand the "Call Preference" section
    Then I should see "Phone Only"
    And I should see "Browser Only"
    And I should see "Phone + Browser"

  Scenario: Phone only is selected by default
    When I navigate to the "Settings" page
    And I expand the "Call Preference" section
    Then the "Phone Only" option should be selected

  Scenario: Browser and both options are disabled when WebRTC not configured
    When I navigate to the "Settings" page
    And I expand the "Call Preference" section
    Then I should see a message that browser calling is not available
    And the "Browser Only" option should be disabled
    And the "Phone + Browser" option should be disabled

  Scenario: Deep link to call-preference section auto-expands it
    When I navigate to "/settings?section=call-preference"
    Then I should see "Phone Only"

  # Vonage has no in-app audio in this codebase: its adapter only dials
  # volunteers' phones and the client has no Vonage audio SDK (issue #728).
  Scenario: WebRTC config not offered for Vonage, which rings phones only
    When I navigate to the "Hub Settings" page
    And I expand the "Telephony Provider" section
