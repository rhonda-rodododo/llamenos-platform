/**
 * `fleet/review` moved to running once per PR, on `merge_group`, instead of
 * on every push (#812) — but a PR still re-enters the queue on every rebase
 * the queue itself performs against other entries, and each re-entry is a
 * fresh `merge_group` event with a full review, even when the PR's OWN diff
 * has not changed at all. This is the second half of the same fix: exactly
 * one review per PR per DIFF, not per queue attempt.
 *
 * Keyed by a hash of the diff's own content, never the head SHA — a rebase
 * that only replays the PR on top of a newer `main` changes the head SHA but
 * not what the PR actually touches, and that replayed diff must still hit.
 *
 * Only a PASS is ever recorded (`record` is never called with anything
 * else — see `runReviewCi` in `ci.ts`), which is what makes "a FAIL is never
 * reused" true by construction: there is nothing to look up for a diff that
 * previously failed, so it is reviewed again every time, exactly like a diff
 * seen for the first time.
