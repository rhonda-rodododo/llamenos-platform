/**
 * Fragment authors write the "Owned paths" / "Does NOT own" sections in two
 * shapes, both of which appear in the real `.claude/agents/fragments/*.md`
 * files:
 *   - bulleted-block: the heading sits alone on its own line, and each path
 *     underneath is a `- \`path\`` bullet (ios, android, desktop, backend,
 *     shared, infra all use this for "Owned paths").
 *   - inline: heading and paths share one line, comma-separated, with free
 *     prose (typically the owning lane's name in parens) trailing after the
 *     last path — e.g. desktop's and backend's "Does NOT own" lines.
 * A parser that only handles the bulleted-block shape silently produces an
 * empty `notOwned` for every real lane, because both real "Does NOT own"
 * lines are inline. That was exactly the bug: desktop's owned `tests/` then
 * looked unqualified, overlapping backend's `tests/features/`/`tests/steps/`
 * — the write-collision this whole scope system exists to prevent. A bullet
 * or an inline heading can also list MORE than one backticked path on a
 * single line (e.g. infra's `Dockerfile*`, `knope.toml`, `Caddyfile*`), so
 * every backtick span on a line is a candidate, never just the first.
 *
 * Not every backtick span is a path, though: backend's sip-bridge bullet is
 * `` `apps/sip-bridge/` — ... (`PBX_TYPE` selects ARI/ESL/Kamailio) `` — the
 * second span is an env var name mentioned in the description, not a path.
 * Backtick spans are kept only when they look path-shaped (contain `/`, `.`,
 * or `*`); a bare identifier like `PBX_TYPE` has none of those and is
 * dropped. Every genuine path in the current fragments contains at least
 * one, so this does not lose real scope.
 *
 * New fragment authors: keep the heading on its own line if you want a
 * multi-bullet list below it, or put the heading and all paths on one line
 * if the whole section is one line — mixing (heading + one inline path, then
 * more bullets below) is not a shape this parser recognizes and will drop
 * the later bullets silently. And any backticked path must contain `/`, `.`,
 * or `*` or it will be silently treated as prose, not scope.
 *
 * To own ONE file at the top level, write it with a leading slash —
 * `/README.md`, not `README.md`. A bare name is a basename pattern and matches
 * that name at every depth in the tree; see `matchesPath` and #1473.

 * `startsWith`, which judges `.github/workflows/ios-e2e.yml` out-of-lane for
 * the ios lane that owns `.github/workflows/ios*.yml` — `*` was never
 * translated into anything a prefix check understands.
 *
 * The bare-filename case matters most for the never-write list: `.env` with
 * a plain `startsWith(file, '.env')` only ever caught a `.env` sitting at
 * the repo root, so a worker was free to write `apps/worker/config/.env` or
 * `deploy/docker/.env` — exactly the secrets file the list exists to block,
 * just one directory down. A pattern with no `/` is therefore compared
 * against the file's last path segment (its basename) instead of the whole
 * path: glob-matched if it contains `*`, otherwise `startsWith` on the
 * basename — which deliberately still over-blocks lookalikes like
 * `.environment` (a `.env`-prefixed basename). That over-block is the safe
 * direction for a deny list and is left as-is; it only ever makes the never-
 * write list MORE conservative, never less.

/**
 * Suffixes that mark a file as a committed, secret-free TEMPLATE rather than

 *
 * Why this list exists at all: `SECRET_PATH_PATTERNS`'s bare-filename entries
 * are prefix-matched against the basename (see `matchesPath`), deliberately,
 * so that `.env` also catches `.env.local` and `.env.production` — a real
 * secret under any environment name. That same prefix match also caught the
 * four `.env*.example` files and the `keystore.properties.example` that are
 * ALREADY TRACKED in this repo as documentation, which made every one of them
 * permanently unwritable by any lane (the `fleet/review` FAIL on #1253 —
 * "touched never-write paths: deploy/docker/.env.example"). A file whose
 * entire purpose is to be committed and read by an operator cannot be a
 * secret, and a deploy template nobody may edit is a deploy nobody may fix.
 *
 * Why a SUFFIX EXCLUSION and not a narrower pattern. The alternative was to
 * stop prefix-matching and instead enumerate what may follow `.env` — exact
 * `.env` plus `.env.<environment>` for a known set of environments. That
 * fails OPEN, and in the worst direction: the day someone adds `.env.prod`,
 * `.env.1984`, or `.env.flokinet` with real values, an enumeration that never
 * heard of that name simply does not match, and the guard waves a live secret
 * through in silence. The exclusion here fails CLOSED instead — anything that
 * does not literally end in one of these suffixes is still a secret, so every
 * environment name that will ever be invented is still caught by default, and
 * the only files that escape are ones explicitly labelled as placeholders.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, and deliberately case-SENSITIVE (no `.toLowerCase()`):
 * `.env.Example` and `.env.EXAMPLE` stay forbidden. Every widening here is a
 * new spelling a secret can hide behind, so the list carries only the three
 * suffixes that have no other meaning anywhere, and `.gitleaks`-style content
 * scanning — a REQUIRED status check on every PR (`.github/workflows/
 * secret-scan.yml`) — remains the defence against a real credential pasted
 * INTO one of these templates. This is a path-shape gate; it never claimed to
 * read file contents, and the carve-out does not change which gate does.
