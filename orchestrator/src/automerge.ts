/**
 * Standard auto-merge: GitHub's own auto-merge (squash, delete branch),
 * requested the moment a PR the fleet dispatched exists — not held back
 * until this fleet's own mechanical verification and non-author review have
 * both passed (that's a SEPARATE, ALREADY-EXISTING arm site — see
 * `tick.ts`'s `enableAutoMerge` call — which stays exactly as it is: it is
 * what re-arms a PR whose branch was pushed to again after this module's
 * open-time request, since a push invalidates the per-SHA required checks
 * and GitHub does not re-request auto-merge on its own).
 *
 * This is NOT a bypass and must never become one. GitHub still withholds
 * the actual merge until every required context on the ruleset is green on
 * that exact head SHA — `ci-status`, `gitleaks`, `CodeQL`, `fleet/verify`,
 * `fleet/review` — and until any code-owner approval CODEOWNERS demands is
 * present. Requesting auto-merge only changes WHEN GitHub notices the PR is
 * ready to land; it never changes WHETHER GitHub will let it.

/**
 * Whether the knope release PR (branch `release` — see
 * `roles/release.ts`'s `KNOPE_RELEASE_BRANCH`) is excluded from standard
 * auto-merge.
 *
 * DEFAULT: `false` — release PRs DO get standard auto-merge today.
 *
 * This is deliberate and TEMPORARY, not an oversight. Merging the knope
 * release PR is not an ordinary version bump: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
 * fires on `pull_request: [closed]` against `main` when the merged PR's head
 * ref was `release`, and it then tags, builds, publishes a GitHub Release,
 * and moves the `docker-stable` image tags — outward-facing and hard to
 * reverse on a public repo. That would normally make it a human's call,
 * always.
 *
 * Right now it is not, on purpose: the release pipeline has never produced
 * an artifact successfully, and that is the standing blocker on Internal
 * Availability. Until it is proven end to end, every merge attempt IS the
 * test, and gating it behind a human reviewer who has to notice and click
 * merge only slows down finding out whether it works. So the release PR is
 * left in scope for standard auto-merge, same as any other fleet PR — it
 * still cannot merge until every required check (`ci-status`, `gitleaks`,
 * `CodeQL`, `fleet/verify`, `fleet/review`) is green and any required
 * code-owner review exists, exactly like every other PR.
 *
 * Flip this to `true` the moment the release pipeline has produced a clean
 * artifact end to end — that one line is the entire re-derivation this
 * switch exists to avoid; nothing else in this file needs to change.
