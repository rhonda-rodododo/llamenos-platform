 * The single resolution point every fleet STATE path below derives from.

 * because this box runs both the real fleet and this test suite: a path that
 * resolved its own `homedir()` independently would silently escape the
 * override the moment someone added a new state file and forgot to route it
 * through here, and an isolation that some paths honour and others don't is
 * worse than no isolation at all (it looks safe while leaking). The test
 * suite points `FLEET_HOME` at a throwaway temp directory (see
 * `vitest.orchestrator.config.ts`) so nothing it does — including the
 * breaker-halt tests, which write the real halt file by design — can ever
 * touch `$HOME/.llamenos-fleet-disabled` on a box that is also running a
 * live fleet. Unset in production, this resolves to the real `homedir()`
 * exactly as before.
