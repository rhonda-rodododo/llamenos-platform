/**
 * G1 (2026-09-12): this ledger records ONLY the fleet's own actions and
 * observations, AT THE TIME they happened — never a durable claim about
 * external state that can drift out from under it. The concrete incident
 * this guards against: issue #660's terminal row recorded `SUCCESS` with a
 * PR link, and `worktree.ts` used to map that straight to a `fleet:merged`
 * label — but the PR was never merged, and nothing here ever re-checked. The
 * label was a CACHE of "what we believed happened", and it went stale the
 * instant it was written.
 *
 * The fix is not a better mapping — any label the fleet writes to describe
 * an outcome can drift the same way. Whether a PR is open, merged, or closed
 * is a fact about GitHub, and is DERIVED ON READ from `gh` (state, mergedAt,
 * headRefOid, reviews) plus this ledger's own rows plus `git` (does the
 * branch/worktree still exist) — see `llamenos-fleet status <issue>` and
 * `digest.ts`'s "waiting on a human" section, neither of which reads a
 * label. Do not add a field here (or a label in worktree.ts) that caches
 * "merged", "reviewed", or any other fact this ledger cannot itself
 * guarantee stays true after the row is written — if it's derivable from a
 * live query, derive it, every time, rather than remembering it once.

/**
 * QUOTA is deliberately not a flavour of FAILED. A provider rate limit is not
 * the fleet misbehaving, and letting it feed the consecutive-failure breaker
 * turns a billing event into a global halt.
 *
 * UNVERIFIED is the same idea applied to this fleet's OWN plumbing rather
 * than a provider's. Issue #870: `fleet-backend-705`, `fleet-desktop-775`,
 * and `fleet-infra-722` all wrote a real terminal `SUCCESS` to their own
 * status file, with a real, working PR — and the ledger recorded all three
 * `FAILED` anyway, because something between the worker and this ledger
 * broke: a re-dispatch's own launch call (`dispatch-one.sh`, which returns
 * almost immediately under normal load) outran its short supervising
 * timeout while three lanes contended for one box at once (backend/705,
 * desktop/775), and a review round's `tmux send-keys` addressed a session
 * the worker had already exited on its own after finishing (infra/722). In
 * neither case did the WORK fail; this fleet's own attempt to talk to or
 * about the worker did. `UNVERIFIED` names that outcome so it reads as
 * "the fleet couldn't confirm this, look at the PR yourself" rather than as
 * "the task failed" — and, like QUOTA, it must never feed
 * `circuit.ts`'s consecutive-failure streak: three verification gaps in a
 * row are not three failures, and halting the fleet over them is exactly
 * the false alarm this outcome exists to prevent.
 *
 * Extension of that same principle (the fix for the #705/#724/#729/#775/
 * #784/#785 incident): `UNVERIFIED` also must never decrement an item's OWN
 * per-attempt retry budget (`failedAttemptsIn`, below) — see that function's
 * doc comment. `needsHuman` (tick.ts) already stops the item being
 * re-claimed while the label stands; the retry budget is a SEPARATE
 * question — "once a human clears that label, how many attempts does this
 * item still have?" — and an infrastructure gap that was never the worker's
 * fault must not have spent any of them, exactly as a QUOTA row never does.
