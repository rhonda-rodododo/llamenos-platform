 * item: a total classification of EVERY open PR into exactly one action, and
 * the infrastructure-vs-substantive split for a failed `fleet/review`.
 *
 * Split the same way `ci.ts`/`status.ts` are: a pure decision function
 * (`buildBoard`) that takes an already-gathered `BoardFacts` and returns a
 * `BoardView` — this is where the classification tests live, with zero
 * network — and a separate, impure gather step (`fetchBoardFacts`) that
 * turns real `gh` calls into that same `BoardFacts` shape. `board` itself
 * (cli.ts) does nothing but call gather then render; it never labels,
 * approves, merges, or re-runs anything (see the module-level "Read-only"

 * already IS a check run... posting a same-named status on top would be a
 * second copy") — so all three currently surface as `CheckRun`, never
