/**
 * The paths where a quiet mistake is expensive in a way CI does not catch.
 * Crypto and protocol: a quiet error becomes an identity disclosure, which
 * is the whole threat model. Auth and sigchain: state a revert does not
 * restore. `orchestrator/` and its tests: a defect there disables the checks
 * that would have caught it.
 *
 * THIS LIST NO LONGER GATES ANYTHING. It used to be half of a userland merge
 * gate — `classifyImpact` marked a diff high and `mayAutoMerge` refused it —
 * enforcement nothing outside this process could see, and therefore nothing
 * outside this process was bound by. Every path below is owned in
 * `CODEOWNERS`, where GitHub's own "require review from Code Owners" rule
 * binds anyone, whoever or whatever opened the PR.
 * `tests/orchestrator/guards.test.ts` asserts that coverage against the real
 * tree, so a path added here without a matching `CODEOWNERS` line fails the
 * suite.
 *
 * What survives here is DESCRIPTION, not decision: the gate trace, the
 * digest, the reviewer's turn and timeout budget (review.ts), and the subset
 * `CRYPTO_REVIEW_PATHS` derives for the crypto-security-reviewer.
 *
 * NOT the full secrets list: every path `checkScope` refuses to write
 * (`SECRET_PATH_PATTERNS` in config.ts, the never-write source of truth) is
 * also classified high-impact below via `matchesPath` — see the `secretHit`
 * check in `classifyImpact`.

// Impact TIERS — a second, independent axis from `classifyImpact` above.
//
// `classifyImpact`'s low/high decides how CAREFULLY a review reads a diff
// that is already going to be reviewed (more reviewer turns, a longer
// timeout — see review.ts's HIGH_IMPACT_MAX_TURNS/HIGH_IMPACT_TIMEOUT_MS).
// It never decided whether a review runs at all, and still doesn't.
//
// A tier decides that: how much CEREMONY a diff's blast radius earns before
// it may land, from "cheap repo checks only" up to "the full gate,
// including a non-author model review." Operator rule, 2026-09-19: "the
// ceremony should scale with impact too. A documentation fix should not
// wait on a model review; an instruction change should not wait on the
// mobile suites; crypto should wait on everything." This is the ONE place
// that rule is defined — `fleet/review`'s decision step (`decideReviewGate`,
// ci.ts) and the CI job path-scoping (`.github/scripts/detect-changed-
// platforms.sh`, once #862 lands — see the note above `TIER1_PATHS`) both
// consume `tierFor` rather than re-deriving their own notion of "this diff
// doesn't need X."
//
// CORRECTED 2026-09-22 (PR #870's own review gate caught this on itself):
// "an instruction change should not wait on the mobile suites" does not
// mean "an instruction change should skip the model review too." The
// original implementation read it that way and put agent-instruction paths
// in Tier 1, which — for the paths CODEOWNERS does not cover — meant no
// review of any kind. An instruction change is exactly the diff whose
// blast radius is largest: it can alter what every FUTURE diff, including
// a malicious one, is judged against. Those paths are Tier 2 now,
// unconditionally — see `AGENT_INSTRUCTION_PATHS` below. Tier 1 keeps the
// mobile-suite exemption; it never had, and never needed, a model-review
// exemption for paths this sensitive.
//
// CORRECTED AGAIN 2026-09-22 (the SAME gate caught the SAME class of defect
// a second time, on the SAME PR): "cosmetic tooling" is not automatically
// "cannot widen what a gate enforces." `eslint.config.js` is JavaScript a
// lint CI step `import()`s and executes; `.eslintrc.json`/`.prettierrc*`
// are not code but ARE sourced and evaluated by that same step, and a diff
// touching only one of them could disable the lint gate entirely. None of
// the seven paths this removed (see `TIER1_PATHS`'s own comment) ever had a
// CODEOWNERS line, so "waits on cheap checks + code-owner review" was as
// false for these as it was for `.claude/skills/` in the first fix — the
// bullet below now says what is actually true of what remains, instead of
// what the tier was originally supposed to mean. The pattern across BOTH
// fixes: every category proposed as "safe to auto-pass" has turned out to
// be executable or authority-bearing. `TIER1_PATHS`'s own comment argues
// the durable fix is a cheap check gating Tier 1 in `ci.ts` (outside this
// file's owned paths, so not implemented here) rather than another round of
// re-curating which paths feel safe.
//
//   Tier 0 — no executable content: `docs/**`, `*.md` outside `.claude/`
//     and outside an agent-instruction basename, spec prose. Nothing here
//     can affect runtime behavior. Waits on cheap repo checks only
//     (lint/typecheck where applicable) — no model review, ever.
//   Tier 1 — data verified (not assumed) to be sourced, evaluated, or
//     executed by NOTHING in this repo: `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`.
//     No lint/format tool config, however inert it looks, because ESLint
//     and Prettier configs (JS or JSON) both resolve `"extends"`/`"plugins"`
//     and apply `"rules"` — capability enough to alter what the lint gate
//     enforces. Waits on cheap checks only. No model review, no e2e/mobile
//     suites, and NOT contingent on CODEOWNERS coverage the way the
//     original design assumed — see `TIER1_PATHS`'s own comment for why
//     that contingency failed twice.
//   Tier 2 — everything else, and ALWAYS: product code, `packages/crypto/`,
//     auth/session/sigchain, `packages/protocol/schemas/`,
//     `.github/workflows/`, `orchestrator/`, `tests/orchestrator/`,
//     dependency manifests, AND — as of PR #870's fix — every
//     agent-instruction path: `.claude/**` (skills, agents, fragments,
//     settings, coordination), `docs/superpowers/specs/`, and any
//     `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`GEMINI.md` file at any depth. Waits on the
//     full gate, including the non-author model review. Also the default
//     for any path this file does not otherwise recognize — an unmatched
//     path is a gap in this classifier, not evidence of safety.
//
// A diff spanning tiers takes the HIGHEST tier it touches — never an
// average, never "mostly docs." `tierFor` below is that computation.

 * `docs/superpowers/specs/`) and `lefthook.yml`'s existing, untouched
 * `HIGH_IMPACT_PATHS` entry (removing it here was enough — that list
 * already forces Tier 2 with full CODEOWNERS coverage).
 *
 * FIXED AGAIN 2026-09-22 (PR #870's review gate caught this on itself a
 * SECOND time): the list above used to also carry `eslint.config.js`,
 * `eslint.config.ts`, `.eslintrc.json`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc`,
 * `.prettierrc.json`, and `.prettierrc.js`. Every one of those is a file a
 * lint/format CI step SOURCES and EVALUATES — `eslint.config.js` is literal
 * JavaScript the lint job `import()`s and executes; the JSON variants are
 * not code, but ESLint/Prettier both resolve `"extends"`/`"plugins"` out of
 * them and apply their `"rules"` verbatim, so a diff touching only one of
 * these could silently disable the very lint gate other PRs rely on as a
 * quality signal — with ZERO review, because (verified against the tracked
 * `CODEOWNERS` file, not assumed) not one of those seven paths has ever had
 * a CODEOWNERS line. The doc comment above claiming Tier 1 "already earns a
 * code-owner review on its own" was true for `lefthook.yml` (removed from
 * this list in the first fix, already Tier 2 via `HIGH_IMPACT_PATHS`) but
 * was never true for any of these seven — a promise this file could not
 * keep, the identical shape as the first fix's `.claude/skills/` finding.
 *
 * Twice now, everything proposed for this tier has turned out to be either
 * executable or authority-bearing over what a gate enforces. The PR that
 * made this second fix argues in its own description that the honest
 * long-term answer is probably "Tier 1 should require a CHEAP check before
 * `ci.ts` lets it skip the model review" rather than nothing at all — but
 * `decideReviewGate` (`orchestrator/src/ci.ts`) currently treats Tier 0 and
 * Tier 1 identically (`tier < 2` → zero engine calls, zero other checks)
 * and that function is outside this file's owned paths
 * (`orchestrator/src/impact.ts`, `tests/orchestrator/`), so it could not be
 * changed here. What COULD be fixed here, unconditionally and without
 * touching `ci.ts` at all: shrink membership to paths verified (by grep — see
 * the guard test in `impact.test.ts`, not a comment's claim) to be sourced,
 * evaluated, or executed by NOTHING in this repo today — `.editorconfig`
 * and `.gitattributes`. Both are pure declarative key/value data (whitespace
 * rules; line-ending/diff/export hints) with no `"extends"`, no plugin
 * loading, and no rule-suppression capability, so a diff touching only one
 * of them cannot alter what any gate enforces or what CI executes. Neither
 * is CODEOWNERS-covered either, but that no longer matters the way it did
 * for `.claude/skills/`: there is no capability left in these two files for
 * an absent human reviewer to have missed.
 *
 * `tierForFile` checks `TIER1_PATHS` AFTER `AGENT_INSTRUCTION_PATHS` (Tier
 * 2, unconditional) and the `HIGH_IMPACT_PATHS`/secret checks, so nothing
 * below can ever shadow a Tier 2 path — the ordering the PR #870 regression
 * tests in `impact.test.ts` pin down. The standing rail in
 * `impact.test.ts` (`TIER1_PATHS admits no executable extension`) asserts
 * this list can never again gain a `.js`/`.ts`/`.mjs`/`.cjs`/`.mts`/`.cts`
 * (or other CI-executed) entry — the exact regression this comment

 *
 * The single source of truth for "how much ceremony does this diff earn" —
 * `fleet/review`'s decision step (`decideReviewGate`, ci.ts) is the first
 * consumer; CI's platform path-scoping (`.github/scripts/detect-changed-
 * platforms.sh`) is designed to consume this same function once #862 lands
 * (see that PR's own script — it currently derives its `docs_only`/platform
 * flags from an independent bash regex map, which this comment does not
 * change; unifying a bash script's classification onto a TypeScript
 * function needs that script to shell out to `bun`, which is out of scope
 * for this change and left as a follow-up named in this PR's description).
