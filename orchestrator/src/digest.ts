/**
 * Issue #641: the first real shadow pass produced 17 rejections for a 3-item
 * backlog, because every lane rejects every item that is not its own as
 * `other-lane`. A histogram counted per-rejection instead of per-item turns
 * "3 items sat on the board" into "17 things are wrong" — the exact
 * misleading shape this histogram exists to prevent, since it is the signal
 * meant to catch a silently broken fleet.
 *
 * `other-lane` is not a reason anything failed — it just means a different
 * lane owns the item. It is ranked lowest here (never chosen when any other
 * reason is present for the same item) and, if it is the ONLY reason an item
 * was rejected, the item is dropped from the histogram entirely: it isn't
 * stuck, it's just not this lane's problem.
 *
 * A `Record<Rejection, number>`, not an array searched with `indexOf`: the
 * array form let an unranked reason silently fall back to rank 0, tying it
 * with `other-lane` and making the outcome depend on Map insertion order —
 * latent today because the array happens to be exhaustive, but a landmine
 * for the next person who adds a `Rejection` variant in `select.ts` without
 * updating this file. `Record<Rejection, number>` requires a key for every
 * member of the union, so an unranked reason fails `bunx tsc --noEmit`
 * instead of silently misranking at runtime.
