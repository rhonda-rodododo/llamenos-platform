/**
 * `llamenos-fleet review-and-merge <pr>` — a coding-agent session reviews a
 * pull request AS the `fleet/review` check-run and, only once every required
 * check (including that one) is green on an unmoved head, merges it.
 *
 * This supersedes running `fleet/review` as a GitHub Actions job
 * (`.github/workflows/fleet-review.yml`) as the PRIMARY way that check gets
 * produced. The Actions version is not deleted here — see that workflow's
 * own file header for why a repo must never have a window with no reviewer —
 * but a coding-agent session run from an operator's own terminal reviews far
 * better than a metered API call boxed into a CI job's turn/timeout budget,
 * and every attempt to hand this to CI cost this repo a PR of pure plumbing
 * (bootstrap ordering, base-ref CLI availability, skipped-vs-absent
 * semantics, label association, engine smoke tests, quota exhaustion). None
 * of that plumbing exists here: this runs on the operator's own machine, with
 * the operator's own `claude` login.
 *
 * GitHub stays the enforcer regardless of where the review ran. This file
 * posts a verdict as a real `fleet/review` check-run — the exact same
 * check-run name the Actions job posts as its own job result — attached to
 * the PR's head SHA via the real GitHub Checks API, so the repo's ruleset
 * treats it identically either way. A stray `gh pr merge` from anywhere else,
 * or a bug in this file's own merge step, cannot skip that: `runMerge` below
 * checks the SAME required-checks state GitHub itself would refuse a naive
 * merge attempt against, and refuses first, with a stated reason, rather
 * than relying on `gh pr merge` to reject afterwards.
 *
 * Every step is pure or dependency-injected (`ReviewAndMergeDeps`) so the
 * five real network/process calls this needs — read the PR, export its head,
 * run the reviewer, post the check-run, merge — are exercised in tests as
 * plain mocks, exactly like every other CI-adjacent file in this
 * orchestrator (`ci.ts`, `review.ts`).
