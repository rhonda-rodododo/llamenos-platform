You are running on a DIFFERENT engine from the one that wrote this diff. \

You are READ-ONLY. You are a reader, not an editor: do not modify any file, \
do not run any command that writes to the repository or to any external \
system, and do not attempt to fix anything you find wrong. If something is \
wrong, say so in your verdict — do not try to patch it yourself.

Check, at minimum:
- Does the diff do what the PR claims, and nothing else?
- Is it confined to the files and directories the author's lane owns?
- Does it introduce any secret, credential, or key material into the repo?
- Does it weaken any existing test, assertion, or security check rather than
  fixing the underlying problem?
- For anything touching crypto, auth, sessions, or identity: does it uphold
  the zero-knowledge and per-user encryption guarantees this project
  requires, or does it quietly narrow them?

  VERDICT: PASS

or

  VERDICT: FAIL — <one-sentence reason>

If you are not confident enough in either direction to write one of those two \
lines, do not guess and do not write anything that could be misread as a \
verdict — an ambiguous or missing verdict is treated as UNREADABLE, which \
blocks the merge exactly as a FAIL would. A confused non-answer must never be \
mistaken for an approval.`

 * The engine every `fleet/review` verdict now comes from — always `claude`,

 * Claude Code SESSION running on a dedicated self-hosted runner

 * THE HONEST COST: when `authorEngine` is `claude` (every configured lane's
 * default — see `LANES` in config.ts), the reviewer is now the SAME MODEL
 * FAMILY as the worker that wrote the diff. It is still a genuinely
 * different process — a separate session with no shared context, on a
 * separate machine, that never sees the author's reasoning or scratch
 * state — but it is no longer an independent VENDOR the way `opencode`
 * (Kimi) was. A model does not review its own blind spots as well as a
 * different model would. The mitigation is operational, not code: run the
 * reviewer on a different MODEL TIER than the lanes use (e.g. `opus` here
 * while lanes stay on `sonnet`) once budget allows — `FLEET_REVIEW_MODEL`
 * (below) is exactly the dial for that, so raising the tier later is a repo
 * variable, not a code change. For a lane whose `authorEngine` is
 * `opencode` (a Kimi-for-Coding lane, per `LaneOverride`), `claude` remains
 * genuinely non-author on every axis.
 *
 * `EngineId` keeps its `opencode` value for AUTHOR engines (a lane may still
 * dispatch its WORKER through opencode/Kimi — see `engines.ts`/`config.ts`);

 * `claude`'s own login state on the self-hosted runner — see

 * conclusion does not) rather than an env var, it became clear that `HOME`
 * has to be in the verifier's environment for it to authenticate at all (see
 * `VERIFIER_ENV_ALLOWLIST` below) — and a process with `HOME` can read
 * `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` and `~/.ssh` directly as FILES, with no
 * dependency on `GH_TOKEN` or `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` being set. A model with shell
 * access and a home directory can `git clone` this repo somewhere else
 * entirely and push from there. **Full containment of that is not
 * achievable by filtering environment variables, and this comment will not
 * pretend otherwise.** What the two mechanisms below actually buy, stated
 * honestly:
 *
 *   1. `exportReviewSnapshot` removes the CONVENIENT path: the verifier is
 *      never hand-fed the author's own worktree to edit and push from
 *      directly. It gets a `.git`-less export instead, so there is nothing
 *      to commit into or push from IN PLACE. `verifierEnv` removes the
 *      CONVENIENT credentials (`GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`,
 *      `GIT_ASKPASS`) — cheap, and it costs nothing, but it does not and
 *      cannot remove the capability once `HOME` is present.
 *   2. `gitState`, checked before and after the review call in
 *      `secondOpinion`, is DETECTIVE, not preventive: it tells us a
 *      verifier modified the author's actual worktree rather than silently
 *      discarding that evidence. It cannot stop a verifier from tampering
 *      by an entirely separate path (a clone elsewhere, a push from there)
 *      that never touches this worktree at all.
 *
 * The defense that actually holds against a verifier with real push access
 * is no longer in this repo's code at all — it is GitHub's. Every fleet gate
 * is a commit status attached to ONE head SHA (ci.ts), and the repo ruleset
 * requires them; a push to the branch moves the head, and the new one
 * carries no green `fleet/verify` or `fleet/review` of its own, so
 * auto-merge simply does not fire. A verifier that pushes a modified branch,
 * by whatever path, invalidates its own approval rather than getting it
 * merged — and no process in this repo has to notice for that to hold.

 * only as an escape hatch for a future non-self-hosted reviewer that
 * authenticates that way instead of via `HOME` login state — it is passed
 * through IF the orchestrator process happens to have it set, never
 * populated by this job today.
 *
 * This allowlist does NOT and CANNOT make the verifier's environment safe
 * on its own: `HOME` alone is enough for it to read `~/.config/gh/
 * hosts.yml` and `~/.ssh` as plain files, regardless of whether
 * `GH_TOKEN`/`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` are set. Excluding `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
 * `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, and `GIT_ASKPASS` removes the CONVENIENT path and costs

 * and run in-process, and an `opencode.json` `mcp` entry was spawned as a
 * command — on the reviewer runner, next to the review key, before the model
 * said a word. `claude` never had that failure mode (its own project root
 * was already this empty scratch directory before opencode was retired — see
 * the `--add-dir` grant below), but the invariant is stated as unconditional
 * on purpose: the export's path reaches the engine only as TEXT inside the
 * prompt (`buildReviewPrompt`), plus the one read grant it needs to open it,
 * regardless of which engine is asking.
 *
 * Layered on top:
 *   - the export has had `REVIEWER_CONTROL_NAMES` and symlinks stripped
 *     before this is called — on its own sufficient against a
 *     project-root-poisoning reproduction, because there is nothing left to
 *     load;
 *   - `--permission-mode plan`: the reviewer can read and reason but cannot
 *     edit files or run destructive commands;
 *   - `--add-dir` grants read access to the export directory specifically —
 *     nowhere else on disk — and never makes it the working directory.
 *
 * `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (used for WORKERS in engines.ts /
 * dispatch-one.sh) is deliberately NEVER passed here — that flag is what
 * lets a worker write without being asked, which is exactly what a reviewer
 * must never be able to do. `--permission-mode plan` already forbids edits
 * and destructive commands, and the reviewer's own read tools (Read, Grep)
 * need no interactive approval under `--print`, so nothing here needs the
 * skip-permissions escape hatch to run non-interactively. The reviewer is
 * never pointed at the author's real worktree either — see the V1 fix note
 * above `gitState`.
 *
 * `model`, when given, overrides `reviewerInvocationFor(authorEngine).model`.
 * Added for `review-and-merge.ts`'s operator command, which always reviews
 * with `claude` at a model tier deliberately different from the authoring
 * lanes' own default (`cli.ts`'s `DEFAULT_MODEL`, `'sonnet'`). Every other
 * property below — the read-only permission mode, the env allowlist, the
 * empty project root, the export as the one readable directory — is

/**
 * Runs the bounded mechanical-verify -> second-opinion -> (on FAIL) revise
 * -> re-verify loop for one pull request, for AT MOST `MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS`
 * rounds. A PASS ends the loop immediately at whatever round produced it —
 * round one never triggers a second round it doesn't need. A mechanical
 * failure ends the loop immediately too, on the same round it happened:
 * secondOpinion may only downgrade a pass, never rescue a failure, so
 * there is no reviewer verdict to revise against in that case, and no
 * `reviseWithWorker` call is made for it either (the mechanical reasons
 * are surfaced to the caller via `lastReport`, and the caller's own
 * `commentOnIssue` path — unchanged from before this loop existed — is
 * what tells the worker what went wrong).
 *
 * `secondOpinion` throwing `VerifierTamperedWorktreeError` is NOT retried,
 * under any circumstance, at any round: it means the review verdict itself
 * cannot be trusted, so revising against it and reviewing it again would
 * only feed a compromised signal back into the loop. `haltFleet` is
 * invoked instead and the loop returns immediately, `needsHuman: true`.
