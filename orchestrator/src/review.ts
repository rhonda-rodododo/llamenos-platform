/**
 * Fix-round finding "V1": running the verifier with `cwd: input.worktree`
 * put it directly in the AUTHOR'S OWN worktree — `.git`, remote, and (via
 * the inherited process environment) every credential that let the worker
 * push in the first place all present. An engine with no enforced
 * read-only mode could then edit, commit, and push the very diff it was
 * supposed to be checking, then print `VERDICT: PASS` on its own patched
 * state.
 *
 * Fix-round finding "W1" narrowed what that first fix actually buys. Once
 * it was confirmed that the reviewer authenticates from state under `HOME`
 * (originally `opencode`'s `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`; today
 * `claude`'s own login state on the self-hosted runner — see
 * `VERIFIER_ENV_ALLOWLIST`'s doc comment — the mechanism differs but the
 * conclusion does not) rather than an env var, it became clear that `HOME`
 * has to be in the verifier's environment for it to authenticate at all (see
 * `VERIFIER_ENV_ALLOWLIST` below) — and a process with `HOME` can read
 * `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` and `~/.ssh` directly as FILES, with no
 * dependency on `GH_TOKEN` or `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` being set. A model with shell
 * access and a home directory can `git clone` this repo somewhere else
 * entirely and push from there. **Full containment of that is not
 * achievable by filtering environment variables, and this comment will not
 * pretend otherwise.** What the two mechanisms below actually buy, stated
 * honestly:
 *
 *   1. `exportReviewSnapshot` removes the CONVENIENT path: the verifier is
 *      never hand-fed the author's own worktree to edit and push from
 *      directly. It gets a `.git`-less export instead, so there is nothing
 *      to commit into or push from IN PLACE. `verifierEnv` removes the
 *      CONVENIENT credentials (`GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`,
 *      `GIT_ASKPASS`) — cheap, and it costs nothing, but it does not and
 *      cannot remove the capability once `HOME` is present.
 *   2. `gitState`, checked before and after the review call in
 *      `secondOpinion`, is DETECTIVE, not preventive: it tells us a
 *      verifier modified the author's actual worktree rather than silently
 *      discarding that evidence. It cannot stop a verifier from tampering
 *      by an entirely separate path (a clone elsewhere, a push from there)
 *      that never touches this worktree at all.
 *
 * The defense that actually holds against a verifier with real push access
 * is no longer in this repo's code at all — it is GitHub's. Every fleet gate
 * is a commit status attached to ONE head SHA (ci.ts), and the repo ruleset
 * requires them; a push to the branch moves the head, and the new one
 * carries no green `fleet/verify` or `fleet/review` of its own, so
 * auto-merge simply does not fire. A verifier that pushes a modified branch,
 * by whatever path, invalidates its own approval rather than getting it
 * merged — and no process in this repo has to notice for that to hold.

 *   permission_denials tools it was refused. `--permission-mode plan`
 *                      denies edits, so a reviewer that keeps reaching for
 *                      one burns a turn per attempt — which is the shape of

 *                      reading anything.
 *
 * On exhaustion the payload carries NO `result` key at all, so the
 * session's work is lost either way; what changes is that we now know it
 * was the budget, and how it was spent.
 *
 * `--tools Read,Grep,Glob` is what that instrumentation then diagnosed, and
 * the actual fix for #1445. The stream from a live re-run of #1445's own
 * prompt was `tools: Bashx13 Readx1`, `num_turns=11`,
 * `permission_denials=0` in 49 seconds: the reviewer was not looping and was
 * not fighting its permission mode — it was WALKING THE EXPORT WITH A SHELL,
 * one `cat`/`find`/`grep`/`sed` per turn, and ran out of budget mid-sentence
 * having never written a verdict. Two things drove it there, both fixed
 * together:
 *
 *   1. `--permission-mode plan` forbids EDITS, not COMMANDS. `Bash` was
 *      fully available and every call succeeded, so the cheapest-looking
 *      way to read one file was `cat <path>` — and a shell read is
 *      inherently one file per turn.
 *   2. The working directory is an empty scratch dir (see
 *      `invokeVerifierEngine`), so `Grep`/`Glob` default to searching
 *      NOTHING. Without being told to pass the export path explicitly, a
 *      search tool looks broken and `find`/`grep` through the shell looks
 *      like the only option. `reviewFilesSection` now names the three tools
 *      and the absolute path they each need.
 *
 * Removing `Bash` from the available set — not merely denying it, so the
 * model never sees it and cannot plan around it — leaves `Grep`/`Glob`,
 * which answer "where is X" across the whole export in one call, and
 * `Read`, which takes an offset/limit, as the only way into the export. A
 * shell made every one of those a separate `find`/`grep`/`sed` round trip.
 * Measured on #1445's own prompt, the flag alone was not sufficient (one of
 * two runs still exhausted, at `Grepx10 Readx5`): it has to arrive together
 * with the `reviewFilesSection` text that tells the reviewer those three
 * tools are all it has and that each needs the export's ABSOLUTE path,
 * because the empty working directory makes an unqualified `Grep`/`Glob`
 * search nothing and an unqualified `Read` fail outright — which is the
 * error #1445's transcript ends on. This is also the stronger security posture the read-only
 * contract already claimed in prose: `READ_ONLY_CONTRACT` tells the
 * reviewer not to "run any command that writes to the repository or to any
 * external system", and until this flag that was an instruction a
 * shell-capable session could simply ignore. `WebFetch` goes with it, so
 * the diff cannot leave the runner through the reviewer either.
 *
 * Narrowing this list is a REVIEW-CAPABILITY decision, not a cosmetic one:
 * a reviewer that cannot search cannot check "is this confined to the
 * lane's files", so `tests/orchestrator/review.test.ts` pins all three
 * names rather than just the absence of `Bash`.

 * mistaken for a CLI flag.
 *
 * THE PROJECT ROOT IS AN EMPTY DIRECTORY THIS FUNCTION CREATES — NEVER THE
 * EXPORT. An agent CLI treats its working directory as a project and loads
 * what it finds there. The now-retired `opencode` reviewer (#812) used to run
 * with `--dir <export>`, so the PR under review WAS the project: a
 * PR-committed `.opencode/tool/x.ts` or `.opencode/plugin/x.ts` was imported
 * and run in-process, and an `opencode.json` `mcp` entry was spawned as a
 * command — on the reviewer runner, next to the review key, before the model
 * said a word. `claude` never had that failure mode (its own project root
 * was already this empty scratch directory before opencode was retired — see
 * the `--add-dir` grant below), but the invariant is stated as unconditional
 * on purpose: the export's path reaches the engine only as TEXT inside the
 * prompt (`buildReviewPrompt`), plus the one read grant it needs to open it,
 * regardless of which engine is asking.
 *
 * Layered on top:
 *   - the export has had `REVIEWER_CONTROL_NAMES` and symlinks stripped
 *     before this is called — on its own sufficient against a
 *     project-root-poisoning reproduction, because there is nothing left to
 *     load;
 *   - `--permission-mode plan`: the reviewer can read and reason but cannot
 *     edit files. It does NOT withhold a shell — #1445's transcript shows
 *     thirteen successful `Bash` calls under this exact mode, with zero
 *     permission denials — which is why the next bullet exists;
 *   - `--tools Read,Grep,Glob` (see `REVIEWER_TOOLS`): the available tool
 *     set, not a permission allowlist, so `Bash` and `WebFetch` are not
 *     present to be reached for at all. This is what actually enforces
 *     `READ_ONLY_CONTRACT`'s "do not run any command", and — because a
 *     shell read is one file per turn while `Read` batches — it is also the
 *     fix for the turn-budget churn;
 *   - `--add-dir` grants read access to the export directory specifically —
 *     nowhere else on disk — and never makes it the working directory.
 *
 * `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (used for WORKERS in engines.ts /
 * dispatch-one.sh) is deliberately NEVER passed here — that flag is what
 * lets a worker write without being asked, which is exactly what a reviewer
 * must never be able to do. `--permission-mode plan` forbids edits and
 * `--tools` withholds the shell entirely, and the reviewer's own read tools
 * (Read, Grep, Glob) need no interactive approval under `--print`, so
 * nothing here needs the skip-permissions escape hatch to run
 * non-interactively. The reviewer is
 * never pointed at the author's real worktree either — see the V1 fix note
 * above `gitState`.
 *
 * `model`, when given, overrides `reviewerInvocationFor(authorEngine).model`.
