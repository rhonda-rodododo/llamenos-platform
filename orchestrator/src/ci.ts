/**
 * The fleet's gates, expressed as the only thing GitHub can actually enforce:
 * two CI jobs named `fleet/verify` and `fleet/review`. Both run their full
 * logic on EVERY pull request, on GitHub's runners, against the PR's head
 * commit — never on the operator's laptop before the PR exists, and with no
 * branch-name opt-out.
 *
 * The migration is complete as of this commit: the ruleset requires both
 * checks, and `merge.ts`'s in-process gate — which nothing outside this
 * process was ever bound by — is deleted. What stops a merge now is GitHub. The previous design decided
 * "may this merge?" in-process and then ran the merge itself; GitHub knew
 * nothing about it, so anyone could merge a fleet PR on the repo's own CI
 * alone, which is what happened to the fleet's first live PR (#662).
 *
 * THE INVARIANT, and the reason this round exists: **the gate never executes
 * code from the commit it judges — it reads it.** The jobs check out the
 * PR's BASE commit, install from the BASE lockfile with `--ignore-scripts`,
 * and run this orchestrator from that trusted tree. The head commit is
 * fetched as an object and extracted with `git archive | tar` into a
 * directory with no `.git` — files, never a checkout, never a module path.
 *
 * The first version of this design checked out the head and ran
 * `bun install` plus the CLI from it. A PR editing `package.json` (an
 * install script) or `bun.lockb` (a postinstall) therefore got arbitrary
 * execution inside both gate jobs BEFORE any verdict was computed — enough
 * to force exit 0 on both and to read the review key out of the runner's
 * HOME. Neither file was code-owned, so no human would have seen it. The
 * judge was running the defendant's code; `fleet/review` itself caught it.
 *
 * Nothing here posts a commit status. An Actions job already IS a check run
 * named after the job, and that name is what the ruleset requires — posting a
 * same-named status on top would be a second copy of the same verdict, and
 * the `statuses: write` permission it needed is exactly what makes fork PRs
 * unmergeable. These functions return a verdict; the CLI turns it into an
 * exit code and prints the reason. Red job, red check, one fact.
 *
 * Check runs are per-commit, so the verified-commit pin the old merge path
 * enforced with a gh flag comes free: a push moves the head, and the new head
 * has no green check of its own. Fail-closed by construction — a job that
 * does not run leaves its required check missing, and the merge is blocked.

    //     red on `not-requested`.

    //     profile's, and a general-only run might legitimately pass. It is
    //     recorded anyway, deliberately, because the alternative is worse
    //     and is a fail-OPEN: a reviewer FAILS on diff D, somebody removes

/**
 * What `fleet-review.yml`'s "Decide whether to run the review engine" step
 * calls, before installing anything. The job carries NO job-level `if:` at
 * all and always reaches a real conclusion (#848: a job instantiated on an
 * event and then skipped by `if:` satisfies branch protection exactly like a
 * green check); this function is the whole decision, and its outcome becomes
 * that step's exit code:
 *
 *  - `review-set-unresolved` — checked FIRST, ahead of everything: the
 *    PR's labels could not be read, or a review the PR asks for (by label
 *    or by its own content) does not resolve to a known agent. FAILS the
 *    job. First because every later branch would otherwise be deciding
 *    against a review set it does not actually know, and "we could not work
 *    out what to review" must never become "nothing needed reviewing".
 *  - `cache-hit` — a prior SUBSTANTIVE verdict exists for this exact diff
 *    AND this exact review set (`reviewSetTag`). No model call either way:
 *    a cached PASS concludes the job successfully, a cached FAIL concludes
 *    it red with the original verdict restated (#1158 — a rebase that does
 *    not change the diff must not re-spend a review to reach the same
 *    conclusion; 10 and 8 runs on two failing PRs in one 12-hour window).
 *    Reached regardless of who the review was requested from, which is what
 *    makes a second review request on an already-reviewed PR cheap and
 *    non-destructive instead of a wasted re-review or (the old bug) a
 *    silently-satisfied skip. Namespacing by the review set is what stops a
 *    general-reviewer-only PASS from standing in for a set that also
 *    includes a profile that never ran. An UNREADABLE is never cached, so an
 *    infrastructure failure is always retried.
 *  - `low-tier` — no cached PASS, no reviewer profile in the set, and `tierFor`
 *    (impact.ts) classifies every changed file as Tier 0 or Tier 1: no
 *    executable content, or instructions/tooling that already earns a
 *    code-owner review on its own. Concludes the job successfully with no
 *    model call, regardless of `requested` — checked BEFORE the request
 *    check below, deliberately: a
 *    docs-only PR must conclude a real, auditable success rather than sit
 *    red forever waiting on a review it was never going to need. The tier
 *    and the file-level reasons are logged (and printed to the job's own
 *    stdout by `runReviewGate`, cli.ts) so the decision is auditable from
 *    the check's own output, not just from reading this file's source.
 *  - `not-requested` — no cached PASS, Tier 2 (a real review is needed), and
 *    either this event did not ask us for one (the review was requested from
 *    somebody else, from a team, or this is not a review-request event at
 *    all — `reviewRequestFor`) or it is a PUSH, which may never start a
 *    review whatever else is true (`republishOnly`, #1284). Fails the job
 *    outright. A `fleet/review` nobody has asked for is not a passing
 *    review, and the old design's mistake was ever treating "not asked for"
 *    as anything other than a fail-closed red check.
 *  - `run-engine` — no cached PASS, Tier 2, the review WAS requested of us,
 *    and this is not a republish-only event. Carries the resolved review set
 *    (`profiles`) into `review-ci`, and the labels to clear once it passes
 *    (`clearLabels`).
 *
 * WHY A PUSH REACHES THIS FUNCTION AT ALL (#1284). `fleet/review` is a
 * required context under `strict_required_status_checks_policy`, so the
 * check has to EXIST on the current head; a rebase moves the head and
 * strands the earned verdict on the old sha. That is a different question
 * from whether a review is WARRANTED, which only a changed diff makes true.
 * Every branch above answers the first question on a push without answering
 * the second: `cache-hit` republishes the verdict this exact diff already
 * earned, `low-tier` and `bot-authored` conclude green on their own terms,
 * and everything else goes red. `run-engine` is unreachable on a push by
 * construction.
 *
 * `runReviewCi` itself resolves the same set and opens with the identical
 * cache lookup — so a direct call to it from anywhere else stays correct on
 * its own — at the cost of one redundant lookup on the `run-engine` path.
 * That redundancy is cheap and never a correctness risk: both reads hit the
 * same cache with the same key and the same namespace.
