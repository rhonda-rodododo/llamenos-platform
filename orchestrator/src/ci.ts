/**
 * The fleet's gates, expressed as the only thing GitHub can actually enforce:
 * two CI jobs named `fleet/verify` and `fleet/review`. Both run their full
 * logic on EVERY pull request, on GitHub's runners, against the PR's head
 * commit — never on the operator's laptop before the PR exists, and with no
 * branch-name opt-out.
 *
 * The migration is complete as of this commit: the ruleset requires both
 * checks, and `merge.ts`'s in-process gate — which nothing outside this
 * process was ever bound by — is deleted. What stops a merge now is GitHub. The previous design decided
 * "may this merge?" in-process and then ran the merge itself; GitHub knew
 * nothing about it, so anyone could merge a fleet PR on the repo's own CI
 * alone, which is what happened to the fleet's first live PR (#662).
 *
 * THE INVARIANT, and the reason this round exists: **the gate never executes
 * code from the commit it judges — it reads it.** The jobs check out the
 * PR's BASE commit, install from the BASE lockfile with `--ignore-scripts`,
 * and run this orchestrator from that trusted tree. The head commit is
 * fetched as an object and extracted with `git archive | tar` into a
 * directory with no `.git` — files, never a checkout, never a module path.
 *
 * The first version of this design checked out the head and ran
 * `bun install` plus the CLI from it. A PR editing `package.json` (an
 * install script) or `bun.lockb` (a postinstall) therefore got arbitrary
 * execution inside both gate jobs BEFORE any verdict was computed — enough
 * to force exit 0 on both and to read the review key out of the runner's
 * HOME. Neither file was code-owned, so no human would have seen it. The
 * judge was running the defendant's code; `fleet/review` itself caught it.
 *
 * Nothing here posts a commit status. An Actions job already IS a check run
 * named after the job, and that name is what the ruleset requires — posting a
 * same-named status on top would be a second copy of the same verdict, and
 * the `statuses: write` permission it needed is exactly what makes fork PRs
 * unmergeable. These functions return a verdict; the CLI turns it into an
 * exit code and prints the reason. Red job, red check, one fact.
 *
 * Check runs are per-commit, so the verified-commit pin the old merge path
 * enforced with a gh flag comes free: a push moves the head, and the new head
 * has no green check of its own. Fail-closed by construction — a job that
 * does not run leaves its required check missing, and the merge is blocked.

 * The three outcomes `fleet-review.yml`'s job-level `if:` used to encode —

 * is what a step INSIDE it calls, before installing the review engine, to
 * decide which of the three branches applies:
 *
 *  - `cache-hit`  — a prior PASS exists for this exact diff. Concludes the
 *    job successfully with no engine call, regardless of which label fired
 *    this run — this is what makes an unrelated label event (say,
 *    `agent-dispatchable` on an already-reviewed PR) cheap and
 *    non-destructive instead of a wasted (or worse, skipped) re-review.
 *  - `low-tier` — no cached PASS, but `tierFor` (impact.ts) classifies every
 *    changed file as Tier 0 or Tier 1: no executable content, or
 *    instructions/tooling that already earns a code-owner review on its
 *    own. Concludes the job successfully with no engine call, regardless of
 *    `requested` — checked BEFORE the label check below, deliberately: a
 *    docs-only PR that never gets the `review` label must still conclude a
 *    real, auditable success rather than sitting on `not-requested` forever
 *    for a review it was never going to need. The tier and the file-level
 *    reasons are logged (and printed to the job's own stdout by
 *    `runReviewGate`, cli.ts) so the decision is auditable from the check's
 *    own output, not just from reading this file's source.
 *  - `not-requested` — no cached PASS, Tier 2 (a real review is needed), and
 *    this run was not the `review` label (nor a manual `workflow_dispatch`).
 *    Fails the job outright: a `fleet/review` a reader has not yet asked for
 *    is not a passing review, and the old design's mistake was ever treating
 *    "not asked for" as anything other than a fail-closed red check.
 *  - `run-engine` — no cached PASS, Tier 2, and the review WAS requested.
 *    The workflow proceeds through engine install, auth, the smoke test and
 *    the real review exactly as before this file's `if:` removal.
 *
 * `runReviewCi` itself still opens with the identical cache lookup (see its
 * own comment) — so a direct call to it from anywhere else stays correct on
 * its own — at the cost of one redundant lookup on the `run-engine` path
 * once this decision has already been made. That redundancy is cheap and
 * never a correctness risk: both reads hit the same cache with the same key.
