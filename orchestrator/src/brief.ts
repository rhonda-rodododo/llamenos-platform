/**
 * Assembles a worker's entire task specification. Every section here exists
 * because of a specific failure mode in the reference system (Atlas): a
 * worker that merged its own PR, one that "helpfully" ran the full suite and
 * burned its whole budget on unrelated flakes, one that silently widened its
 * scope instead of saying so, and one that wrote a status file with no
 * parseable terminal outcome so the orchestrator had to guess.
 *
 * Fix round 2, M2: this used to also take `priorAttempts` and append its own
 * "Previous attempts" section — duplicating `memory.ts`'s `augmentBrief`,
 * which does the identical filter-by-item / sort / cap-at-three / render
 * under a different heading ("Prior attempts on this item"). A caller that
 * used both (as `cli.ts` did, and as `tick.ts` was always going to) would
 * render the same failure history twice under two headings — precisely the
 * "wastes the worker's context for no information" failure this brief
 * exists to avoid, reached by a path no test caught. `memory.ts` is now the
 * SOLE owner of prior-attempt history: this function no longer takes or
 * renders it at all, which makes double-rendering structurally impossible
 * rather than a wiring convention someone has to remember. Any caller that
 * wants prior-attempt context must go through `augmentBrief`.
