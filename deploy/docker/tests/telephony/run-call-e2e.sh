# Drive a real SIP call through self-hosted Asterisk, end to end.
#
# Starts, in its own compose project: the app (the shipped image, built from
# this tree) with its own Postgres and RustFS, Asterisk (the hotline PBX, with
# no SIP trunk), the sip-bridge image, and a simulated PSTN carrier — all on
# one Docker network, as in production. Then runs asterisk-call.e2e.ts, which
# provisions a hub and the SIP trunk through the API, places calls from the
# carrier and asserts the worker and PBX state, and what the caller heard.
#
# Usage: deploy/docker/tests/telephony/run-call-e2e.sh [--keep] [playwright args…]
#   --keep          leave the containers running afterwards (for poking at them)
#   e.g. -g 'hears the prompt'  run only the scenarios matching a title
#   E2E_ARI_DEBUG=1 log every ARI event in the Asterisk container's output
#
# Needs: Docker. Nothing else: the stack shares no database, port or volume
# with the dev stack (docker-compose.dev.yml) beyond the PBX's SIP/ARI ports.
