# check-bddgen-warmup.sh — Fail if any bddgen invocation skips the transform-
# cache warm-up.
#
# Why: bddgen generates every BDD project at once (one in the main thread,
# the rest in worker threads) and Playwright's TS transform cache is written
# non-atomically, so on a cold cache a thread can read a step file another
# thread is still writing — it loads empty (steps come out "missing") or
# truncated (bddgen crashes). Measured on cold caches: 4/22 bare runs failed,
# 0/25 with the warm-up. See the build job's comment in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml for the full writeup.
#
# The fix is always the same one-line, single-`run:`-step form:
#   bunx bddgen export > /dev/null && bunx bddgen
# This script only recognizes that exact form. It has been missed twice
# already (#1211, then the since-folded desktop-e2e.yml) — this rail exists
# so a third bare
# call site fails CI instead of flaking in the wild.
#
# Scope: only the surfaces that actually execute bddgen (workflows, scripts,
# lefthook, package.json) — not docs or historical plans, which can describe
# bddgen without invoking it.
#
# Exit code: 0 = pass, 1 = bare invocation found
