/**
 * Desktop backend address configuration (Epic #738).
 *
 * A packaged Tauri build loads the webview over the `tauri://` asset protocol,
 * where a relative `/api` path resolves to nothing — there is no HTTP server
 * behind `tauri://`. This module is the single source of truth for "which
 * backend does this installed app talk to", and every other module derives its
 * URLs from it.
 *
 * - `src/client/lib/api.ts` and `webauthn.ts` build request URLs via `getApiUrl()`.
 * - `src/client/lib/net.ts` reads `getApiBase()`/`isAbsoluteUrl()` to decide whether
 *   a request must be routed through the Rust-enforced network proxy (#739).
 * - `src/client/lib/relay/context.tsx` derives the WebSocket origin via `deriveWsBase()`
 *   instead of `window.location.host`, which is meaningless under `tauri://`.
 *
 * Persistence lives in Rust (`apps/desktop/src/api_config.rs`, reached through
 * `platform.ts`), which validates the address again before storing it and is the
 * same value the Rust network allowlist enforces. The webview has no store-plugin
 * permission for it.
 *
 * In dev (`bun run tauri:dev`) and Playwright test builds, Vite's own proxy
 * (`vite.config.ts`) forwards relative `/api`/`/ws` to a real backend, so the
 * default relative base is intentionally preserved there — see `needsServerAddress()`.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: `cachedApiBase` stores an ORIGIN only (`https://host:port`, no
 * path) — or `''` for the relative dev/test default. `getApiUrl()` always
 * appends `/api` explicitly so the stored value never needs a hardcoded path
 * baked in. Auth token signing (`api.ts`/`webauthn.ts`) uses `getApiPath()`
 * instead of `getApiUrl()` — it must always sign the request's *pathname*
 * (`/api/...`), never the full origin, because the server verifies the
 * signature against `url.pathname`, which is the same regardless of which
 * host served the request.

 * is configured while the persisted config (and any in-flight confirmation,

 * before this) reactively remounts `ServerAddressScreen`, which consumes the
 * staged pending address and auto-submits it — straight into a health probe
 * that the Rust/mock IPC refuses with "a server is already configured",
 * because it still is. That one-shot probe failure permanently strands the
 * user on an empty first-run screen with no address left to retry, since the
 * pending address was already consumed by the premature mount. Reordering so
 * `cachedApiBase` only flips once the clear has genuinely completed collapses
 * this window to nothing — the very next statement in the caller is
 * `window.location.reload()`, so a real reload follows immediately instead of
 * a reactive swap racing an in-flight clear. It also means a rejected/canceled
 * confirmation (the whole point of #788's gate) leaves `cachedApiBase`
 * untouched, rather than wrongly showing "unconfigured" for a clear that
