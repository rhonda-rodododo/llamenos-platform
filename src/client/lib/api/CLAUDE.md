# CLAUDE.md — src/client/lib/api

The desktop HTTP client. Every module here wraps backend routes that are
already fully described by Zod schemas in `packages/protocol/schemas/`.

## The rule

**Derive types. Never hand-write them.**

`packages/protocol/schemas/` is the single source of truth for every request
body and every response shape in this directory. It exports **547 schemas**.
If you are typing a request or a response here, the type already exists —
import it, or infer it from the schema. Writing the shape out by hand is the
defect this file exists to prevent, and it is not a style preference: a
hand-written type compiles cleanly while disagreeing with the server, so
nothing fails and the drift ships.

```ts
// WRONG — a second, unverified copy of a shape the server already defines
export async function createUser(data: { name: string; phone: string; roleIds: string[]; pubkey: string }) {
  return request<User>(hp('/users'), { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(data) })
}

// RIGHT — one definition, enforced by the same schema the server validates with
import type { CreateUserBody, User } from '@protocol/schemas'

export async function createUser(data: CreateUserBody) {
  return request<User>(hp('/users'), { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(data) })
}
```

TypeScript consumers import the PascalCase types from `@protocol/schemas`
directly — no codegen step is needed for TS. (`bun run codegen` exists for
Swift and Kotlin, which cannot import Zod.)

If the PascalCase type does not exist yet, add it next to its schema in
`packages/protocol/schemas/`, e.g.
`export type CreateUserBody = z.infer<typeof createUserBodySchema>` — one line
there, reusable by every consumer. Do not reach for `z.infer` at the call site
in this directory, and do not define the shape locally.

## Why this keeps regressing

The pattern is self-replicating. Someone adding an endpoint copies the
function next to it, and the neighbour hand-writes its types, so the next one
does too. Nothing breaks: `bun run typecheck` passes because an inline type is
internally consistent — it simply is not the server's type. There is no
feedback until something fails at runtime, or silently returns a field the UI
never reads.

These are real, current examples from this directory, not hypotheticals:

- `createUser` accepts **4 fields**. `createUserBodySchema` defines **10** —
  `teamId`, `supervisorPubkey`, `specializations`, `maxCaseAssignments` and
  more are unreachable from the client, with no compile error to say so.
- `listUsers` is typed `{ users: User[] }`, where `User` is
  `userAdminResponseSchema` (it has `phone`). The route actually returns
  `userListResponseSchema`, whose members are `userResponseSchema` — **no
  `phone`**. The client over-claims a field the endpoint does not send.
- Across this directory: **352 exported functions, 263 inline object types,
  and only 21 imports from `@protocol/schemas`.**

## Before you add or edit a function here

1. Find the route's schemas in `packages/protocol/schemas/` — request body and
   response both. The naming is consistent: `createXBodySchema`,
   `updateXBodySchema`, `xResponseSchema`, `xListResponseSchema`.
2. If a schema is genuinely missing, add it **there** and use it from both
   sides. Do not work around its absence with a local type.
3. Use the shared `request` / `hp` helpers from `./client`. Those are the only
   hand-written transport concern in this directory; everything else is shape,
   and shape comes from the protocol package.
4. Keep modules domain-scoped, one file per domain, as they are now. `api.ts`
   at the parent level is a re-export barrel only — put no logic in it.
