/**
 * Desktop API client — re-export barrel (Issue #742).
 *
 * This file used to hold the entire desktop API surface (3000+ lines). It has
 * been split into domain modules under `./api/` — see that directory for the
 * actual implementations. This file is now a thin barrel that re-exports the
 * full original surface from a single import path (`@/lib/api` /
 * `src/client/lib/api`), because ~140 files across the desktop client import
 * from it. Re-pointing every one of those at a specific domain module would
 * be a much larger, much riskier mechanical change for no behavioral benefit;
 * this barrel keeps the split reviewable as a pure move (no call site diffs)
 * while still capping every module's own size at ~400 lines.
 *
 * New code may import directly from `./api/<domain>` (matching the existing
 * `./api/hub-onboard` and `./api/provider-setup` convention) or continue
 * importing from here — both resolve to the same implementation.
